0,0,0,0,6922,We took off from ZZZ as usual. We were on the departure and ATC queried us saying we were off course about 10 degrees. I immediately looked to see if I may have left autopilot in heading mode but FMS 1 was displayed. I asked Person X to tell him we are showing we are on course. Again; ATC said he was showing 10 degrees off. I went to received messages in the FMS and saw that ATC had given us a reroute adding ZZZZZ to our fixes on the departure. I went to the fix page and brought the fix we were missing and we were almost a beam the fix. I asked the FO to ask ATC if he wanted us to turn there. ATC gave us a switch to next sector frequency and we asked him if he wanted us to turn there. He advised us 'out of FL240 direct ZZZ.' We maintained our course and at FL240 initiated the turn to ZZZ.I honestly don't have a reason why I didn't check the clearance on ACARS as I do every-time to verify what the FO wrote down. I hadn't flown in about a month and I guess I was just out of my groove to not check the received messages. The FO put AF 'as filed' down on the card and I went with it.

1,1,1,1,5110,The student was forced to maneuver our aircraft in order to avoid a radio controlled (RC) airplane being operated near the RC Park on the northwest end of Utah Lake. We were performing ground reference maneuvers over the Lehi/Saratoga Springs area at 5;500 FT MSL putting us about 1;000 FT AGL. While in a left hand turn the student saw the RC plane and reacted immediately by turning the aircraft to the right in order to avoid the hazard. As the student turned our airplane to the right I was able to see the RC plane approximately 200 feet above us performing maneuvers and dives to include a dive through our original flight path and altitude. The student wisely decided to move to a different area to perform his ground reference maneuvers. As I watched the RC plane maneuver I felt that it was intentional and that he was attempting to 'mess with us' or show off.

2,2,2,2,2764,In our Routine Overnight Hangar we are repeatedly being electrically shocked by the aircraft while performing nightly maintenance. This has only been an issue this year. This has been repeatedly brought to Management's attention and we have been told that licensed electricians have been brought in when available at their convenience to look at the problem and [that] there is none. What is happening when the aircraft comes to the hangar for nightly maintenance. We need to hook-up a ground power [electrical] cart to supply electrical power to the aircraft. The ground power cart is hooked-up to the electrical drop located at the north end on the hangar. It is a dual hook-up cart (can supply power to two aircraft at one time). We were told that the reason we are getting shocked is because the aircraft is not grounded to the hangar floor. When an aircraft is grounded; it is to make the aircraft and what it is grounded to; electrically the same. I was personally getting shocked when hooking up the aircraft to ground. I took out my Volt Meter and found we are passing Alternating Current (AC) volts and amps from the aircraft to the hangar floor ground [connection]. This should not happen. The power cart should be supplying the electrical ground back to the power source. This is dangerous because somewhere we are not providing a way for the power cart to return all the voltage back to the power source ground and it is building up on the aircraft. [The] poor hangar wiring has been brought to Management numerous times as stated and we have been told that licensed electrical technicians have been into check out the hangar and power cart and are not able to find any significant findings. We have also been told that the licensed electrical technician believes that it is because it has been so dry and the dirt around the building grounding rod is dry; not allowing all the power to return to ground. Obviously it is still a problem even after the electricians have checked out the power source. It is a dangerous situation every night. It does not happen every night. The wiring needs to be thoroughly gone over. It is getting to the point that we do not want to work on the aircraft because we are getting shocked.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

4,4,4,4,5773,We accepted a release and subsequently departed without an alternate with weather in the TAF that should have required an alternate and the associated fuel. We discovered the error enroute to ZZZ when we noticed the poor forecast in the most recent weather and looked back to compare that against our release. We immediately contacted Dispatch via ACARS to discuss options. Dispatch advised they were surprised the release went out before they could add the alternate and the fuel as they had done for several other ZZZ flights. We further discussed fuel on board and the possibility of using ZZZ1 or ZZZ2 as an alternate or using exemption 10;000 lbs. We briefly lost ACARS communication during this process; but we were able to restore ACARS and reach a joint decision based on our fuel on board to divert to ZZZ3 to refuel and continue to ZZZ. We advised ATC; flight attendants; and passengers of the diversion; landed in ZZZ3 and subsequently departed for ZZZ after refueling without issue. I believe origins for this error lie in the airborne holding we were assigned on our inbound flight from ZZZ4 to ZZZ5 due to VIP movement. This holding resulted in a significant arrival delay; cutting our scheduled turn time for our ZZZ leg down to about 20 minutes during which we also were completely changing out the cabin crew as well. This led to us feeling time pressured to accomplish our tasks to turn the aircraft for our ZZZ departure. During the turn I set [briefer] to download the flight briefing for ZZZ and immediately went outside to do my walk around. When I returned; I looked at the weather summary dots for the destination and not noticing anything; I pulled the release and other documentation from Dispatch. I saw no alternate listed there and with the time crunch; I continued on with my preflight preparations without looking further at the weather in the release under the assumption that if I hadn't noticed any indication of poor weather in [briefing] and there was no alternate listed on the release that we were appropriately planned and filed. The Captain was also task saturated during this time with his responsibilities during the turn; resulting in neither of us catching the dispatch error. The most obvious would be to slow down and make sure I take the time needed to fully evaluate the flight paperwork during such high pressure quick turn scenarios; even if this may result in a longer than 'published' turn time. Base on our conversation with Dispatch during the event I was left with the impression that some of the 'sending' of the flight release is automated and can occur without the Dispatcher giving final direct send approval. If that is the case; I would suggest either removing that function of their software automation and asking the Dispatcher manually responsible for the send command for a release or equip the automation with some ability to error check before sending paperwork on its own.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

6,6,6,6,8372,Beautiful day; calm winds and unrestricted visibility. I was the pilot flying; and after a short taxi; we were ready for departure from 28R. I was feeling great and I wanted to hand fly. We got cleared for takeoff and got instruction; runway heading. Passing through 1200-1300; Capt. called acceleration alt; and I asked for climb sequence; FLCH and VNAV; but I said no autopilot. At the same time we got a turn to 190; and I started turning before Capt. adjusted the heading bug. At this time I am looking away from my PFD for a couple of seconds and when I look back at it; my FD and Path Vector were not in agreement; so I got confused. The FD was indicating a 30 degree left turn; with a very low nose up attitude; but my Path Vector was showing a shallow left turn with a bigger nose up attitude. So in my confusion; I was trying to bring the FD to the Path Vector; increasing the pitch attitude; instead of putting 'the green thing on the pink thing'. At this point; Capt. start saying 'lower the nose'; and I think I did; but not sufficient enough. As a result; airspeed started decreasing and stick shaker activated. I pushed the nose down; but now the airspeed was increasing and got in to the amber; so I pitched up again; and shaker came back again. At some point Capt. suggested autopilot and after I recovered from the shaker. I asked for autopilot. I let my guard down; I was very relaxed and took flying that day too lightly. It took a split second for me to get disoriented and confused by looking away from the PFD after I started a turn ahead of the FD bug. After the new heading was selected; and I looked back at the PFD; I was behind already. I didn't know which one is me; so even though my instinct was telling me something; looking at the PFD was telling me something else; at least that's what I was thinking. We are so used to see the FD and the Path Vector always on top of each other; that when it happens that they are not; it can be confusing; as in my case. I think that the lack of experience flying this flight instruments display; in my case coming from a different FD display; played a big part in my confusion. The event was a wakeup call for me; and I am lucky I had an experienced Capt. next to me who didn't panic and kept calm instructed me how to recover.

The airspeed quickly rose above the Flaps 3 limit of the aircraft. During our debrief; the Captain and I thought it was about 10 knots above the limit for 2 to 3 seconds. I called for the landing gear to help manage the speed. Airspeed returned to normal; we continued to configure for landing; and landed uneventfully.

We were heading 330 and I was thinking a turn to 350 was coming so 280 heading caught me a little off guard. I (FO) was pilot flying. The sun was just above the horizon as I looked west and across the cockpit for the field.  Simultaneously I was looking cross-cockpit and programing the speed and heading change into the FMC. I could make out the field so I said to the Captain (PM); 'I can see the field; you can call it in sight.'  I noticed another aircraft on TCAS at our altitude on TCAS and then saw them visually less than ten miles away; also headed west toward ZZZ [Airport]; I noted the  paint scheme and relayed to the PM all that information and that they were probably headed to the north side of the airport.  In my head I was thinking that our airplane was not slowing down as fast as I would like when the PM said 'where is that airplane; I think we need to turn.' I pushed the localizer button on the FMC but the airplane did not turn so I turned the autopilot off and manually turned to intercept final for [Runway] XXR. As I did; we received at TCAS TA then a few seconds later a TCAS RA to climb.  The ADI showed a red boxed area from level flight down (I was descending) so I just leveled off until we heard 'clear of conflict.'

I was able to correct the high energy level of the airplane using gear; flaps; and speed brakes and continued the approach and landed uneventfully.Fast close to the airfield; sun in eyes; failure on my part to use automation.Something from ATC that I was going to turn towards the runway instead of downwind in the [Runway] XXR pattern or an advisory where we were in the sequence.

11,11,11,11,2396,A B757-200 was departing Runway 25R. The LC2 assist was unable to rundown the departure via automation; had to verbally run down aircraft. I investigated as to the cause of the 'dup id' message and found that there was another flight with same call sign; but as an arrival to LAX. The 'T' affixed to the end of the callsign led me to believe the departure was a continuation of this arrival; and that the arrival had already landed and the RADAR track was in coast mode; not uncommon at LAX. I removed the arrival control by using the OK function. The departure rundown was now completed via automation. Later I found out that the arrival was still inbound; and due to my actions; the data tag had been lost; but the RADAR track was still displayed. In removing the arrival control track; I created the same situation I was trying to prevent; i.e. have an aircraft airborne with no associated data tag. In this case; an un-tagged departure would have been better than an un-tagged arrival. The first change would be to discuss with the company why they used a 'T' suffix on two callsigns; when the use of the suffix is to resolve confusion to same callsign events (like this one). A better fix would be to use two different suffixes; a 'Q' or 'J' etc.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
12,12,12,12,5271,[The First Officer] and I flew Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1. During the cruise portion of the flight; we both felt the airplane vibrating a bit more than usual. We looked around near the engine and props to see if anything from that area would cause the vibration and also looked at the engines performance page on the Multi Function Display screen to see if there were any abnormalities. Everything was performing normally and we decided to scan everything through our window starting from the inboard part of the wing; then the engine and the outboard part of the wing. We ensured the flaps were up as well. We then looked at the horizontal stabilizer and saw it shaking up and down as if the plane was hitting turbulent air. It looked a bit more than what we usually see. We both agreed we could continue safely to ZZZ1 but would divert and land immediately if we felt the vibration get any worse. As we continued to fly the vibration was intermittent. There was not a repetitive pattern rather the plane would vibrate for 10-20 seconds and then return to a normal vibration. During our descent the vibration was more frequent; instead of intermittent; but was not more intense. Once we parked at the gate in ZZZ1; I examined the rear section of the aircraft and called maintenance to request someone come look with me. During the inspection I saw that a screw had pierced through the plate which is connected to the horizontal stabilizer and the bottom of the fuselage. We brought the plane to the maintenance hangar and I asked [the] ZZZ1 Maintenance Manager to look at the plane with me and I told him about what I found. As he inspected the screws in the plate on the other side of the fuselage a screw fell out in his hand. I then called Maintenance/Operations Control and told them what was happening since the plane was going to be written up and our next flight was going to be delayed.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
13,13,13,13,528,I had inadvertently returned a Learjet to service on many occasions with questionable inspection records for the T Piece Seal on an [engine]. The inspection record for this part was missing an inspector's stamp; but had been signed by the tech who had performed the inspection. I was alerted to the discrepancy by the overhaul facility and was later contacted by their vendor's FSDO. During our discussion; the inspector and I came to the conclusion that the part had sufficient life remaining to make it to the next Major Periodic Inspection (MPI) Inspection because it had been inspected previously; before installation on another engine; and had sufficient life remaining until a new inspection would have been due if the part had stayed on the original engine. I called my operator's Principle Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for concurrence and it was concluded that the logic was sound and we could continue to fly the engine until the next MPI Inspection was due. This afternoon; my operator's Director of Maintenance called me and to inform me that our Principle Operations Inspector (The previous PMI who had concurred with the vendors PMI had moved to another assignment) had questions about the airworthiness and documentation for this part. Together; the PMI and our Director of Maintenance determined that the aircraft would be considered not airworthy. In my conversation with the Director of Maintenance; he said that our PMI had determined the week before that this discrepancy did not call in to question the airworthiness of the part. I could not provide any documentation of the conversations with FAA inspectors from when this discrepancy had originally occurred. The FAA is not prepared to help us make a determination of the airworthiness of this part in any other way but to open an investigation.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
14,14,14,14,8686,I was working Radar when tower called to coordinate departures. I had a law enforcement VFR aircraft at 3200 feet in the departure corridor; so I instructed the traffic to remain at or above 3000 feet. I approved Tower to launch departures at 2500 feet. Aircraft X departed first. I waited until he was past the traffic before climbing and turning him to a 360 heading and capped him at 6000 feet reference traffic at 7000 feet 15 miles north of him. Then second departure took off and went south. I separated the second departure from the traffic and vectored him to intercept a victor airway. I then went back to Aircraft X; scanned ahead and did not observe any traffic in his way. I cleared him to 10000 feet. I spoke to multiple aircraft in the meantime; revectored my southbound departure to intercept the victor airway on a better heading; and then turned to the FDIO (Flight Data Input/Output) to make an amendment. That's when I heard the Conflict Alarm go off in close proximity to Aircraft Y southeast bound at 7500 feet. I observed Aircraft X at 7000 feet; then rapidly dropped in altitude to 6600 feet. At that time I instructed Aircraft X to maintain 7000 feet just before I observed the altitude change to 6600 feet. Aircraft X then advised me he was taking evasive action.I believe I missed Aircraft Y at 7500 feet due to it being obscured by full data block traffic that I was working at the same position of the unidentified limited data block 7500 feet. Maybe if the full data block would auto toggle to a different position even if the other target is a limited data block. I'm 100% sure I scanned ahead prior to sending Aircraft X on course and climbed him to 10000 feet; and did not see Aircraft Y at the time I made the transmission.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

17,17,17,17,4182,LGA was landing/departing RWY 4. Aircraft x was sent around by LGA Tower due to a 'slow roller' departing same runway.  Tower Coordinator called Radar Coordinator (myself) informing us of the go-around and the callsign. I asked Tower what climb out the next departure was doing and he stated he was on a 360 heading (standard climb out for a west/south gate departures); and the go-around was 'going by the sheet.'  'By the sheet' means the standard go-around/missed approach procedures document which states what the Tower will instruct a go-around on various runway configurations *only if the Tower Coordinator cannot get in contact with the Radar Coordinator*. In this case; the go-around was assigned left turn heading of 340 and a climb to 2;000 FT.  I told tower Coordinator to give the go-around a runway heading to 3;000 FT and to stop departures behind; but Tower advised that he was already in the left turn.  So I then stated to head 340 and climb to 3;000 FT and stop departures behind.  Tower Coordinator acknowledged.  I called Tower Coordinator a second later to give them the correct frequency to give the go-around.  When I went to instruct Departure of what was being coordinated; separation was already lost between the go-around and the departure.  I had zero time to inform the Departure Controller of the instructions the go-around was given. Aircraft x was switched to Departure; he checked in out of 1;000 FT climbing to 2;000 (did not state a heading); and a vector was given to the go-around well prior to my coordination being completed with the Tower.  The Departure Controller was under the assumption that the go-around was runway heading due to the radar track appearing to remain runway heading and gave a right turn to a 090 heading; not knowing that the go-around was beginning the left turn to a 340.  The departure Aircraft Y was airborne (climbing to 5;000 FT; left turn to a 360) around the same time the go-around began his right turn to the 090 heading.  Aircraft Y checked in with Departure about 4 DME north of LGA climbing out of 3;500 (est.).  Fortunately; the go-around saw the departure off his right side; but well after separation was lost and the departure aircraft also had the go-around aircraft visually as well on initial contact. The fact that the Tower switched the go-around to Departure well before the aircraft was established on a 340 heading; in my opinion; is not ensuring separation with a departure also making a left turn northbound. Aircraft X was given go-around instructions and switched to Departure almost instantaneously.  When the Tower called me about the go-around; I never had the notion that the aircraft was already switched to Departure.  Like other go-around traffic; my belief is that the Tower still has the go-around on their frequency ensuring that the go-around will be properly separated by the departure.  For this specific configuration (land/depart Runway 4) a standard go-around is to be issued a left turn to a 340 and a climb to 2;000.  Departures are assigned either a left turn to 360; or runway heading; dependent on their initial fix on their flight plan.  I believe this is a hazard due to the high possibility that a departure can go airborne on a left turn 360.  Having a go-around also executing a left turn 20 degrees more to the left is not the safest operation since the go-around is cleaning up the aircraft.  The go-around turn could be wider than that of the departures turn. The departure plans on the turn as soon as their airborne; the go-around does not plan for a turn as fast and could take that extra second or two to begin the turn.  On an IFR day; two aircraft turning in the same direction in the same vicinity could be trouble.  There are other configurations with go-around/missed approach procedures on the sheet that need to be considered for review/revision in my opinion if it were to be followed on *every go-around*. For the configuration mentioned in thisincident; the go-around should do opposite of what the departure aircraft is assigned. For example; an aircraft on final is issued a go-around due to a slow roller and the departure will be turning to a 360 heading. Assign the go-around runway heading. If the departure was assigned runway heading; then give the go-around the left 360.  If divergence is still a question; amend the departures altitude to a lower altitude than the go-around since the go-around is already airborne.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
18,18,18,18,3420,The APU went out on this plane before landing initially in ZZZ.  Of course; it was deferred and we were cleared to return to ZZZ1.It was a warm day - not exceptionally so; but hot. These airplanes retain heat all the time; but with a broken APU; the plane becomes a miserably hot metal tube.I had a plane at maximum capacity with a lot of large; hot passengers.  I also had a plane with elderly passengers; small; crying children; and people who did not understand English. All were compliant with the masks; but I also know those masks are dangerous in heat.  The CDC has listed these warnings on their website and in their tweets.  I was very concerned about their health and the heat inside the cabin.While returning the cart to the galley after service; I began to get light headed.  I stood behind the bulkhead (away from passenger view) and removed my mask to breathe oxygen.  I also had to fill a glove with ice to put on the back of my neck to cool myself.  I was very concerned; if I felt that way on a spring day what are the rest of my plane of passengers experiencing?Masks are a very serious and concerning safety issue on hot planes - especially this type and especially when temperatures are climbing.  The summer is going to be a hazard to everyone's masked health - including customers and crew.The mask policy on airplanes needs to be reviewed by the FAA - especially on this make and model.  There are serious safety issues caused by the mask mandates.  Anyone with asthma; heart conditions; lung issues and those who are extremely obese are already at risk when their bodies are exposed to heat.  Constricting their ability to breathe oxygen and fresh air is a danger in HOT spring and summer conditions.

20,20,20,20,3734,Two flights ago in flight training my instructor had taught to keep fuel in mind and to switch tanks periodically during flight as well as when following the checklist. The next flight an engine failure was simulated and upon switching fuel tanks my instructor restored power to the aircraft. Both lessons were among the flight training lessons I had learned were in mind during this flight. I had rested well the night before; had eaten a good breakfast; was not on any medication; and all my paperwork was current. After taking off with full fuel tanks; the plane flew normally during VOR practice and soft field landings at ZZZ1 airport and the fuel tanks were switched about every 15 minutes. Upon returning to ZZZ; I followed the checklist and in doing so switched fuel tanks again. I then completed two landings and take offs. On the third my instructor initiated another simulated engine failure abeam the numbers on downwind. I thought of the previous lessons and decided to switch fuel tanks again after establishing the glide speed and planned to land on runway X. Once I was set up to land and on final for runway X my instructor allowed me to add power as I deemed necessary. The landing was successful and since we were doing touch and go's I set up the aircraft and added power for takeoff. After successful rotation I established the initial climb. About 50ft above the runway surface the engine lost power. My instructor took the flight controls then and landed back on runway X. We rolled off the runway threshold into the grass along the center line. The plane stopped before hitting the fence. The engine was still running at idle at that point; so my instructor radioed ZZZ Tower and they gave us clearance to taxi off the grass and onto the ramp but no further. After looking at the fuel selector switch my instructor and I determined that it was past the left fuel tank mark between it and the shutoff position.

Three or four other holes at various spots and 3-inch x 1-inch wide section of rub strip missing.Inspected engine; found no FOD damage in core. Found 3-inch long gash in lower core cowl. [I] plotted all damage and faxed location; size and depth of damage to Maintenance Control. Removed and installed new [fan] blades and was told by Control they were working to try to get a ferry flight [permit] and not fix damage until it got back home. At this time we had timed-out and had to go to hotel for rest. Came out of rest next day and found out they had ferried aircraft back home. Returned home and wanted to see what had been done to get it safe for a ferry flight; saw that they had applied speed tape inside inlet cowl and containment case with no other restriction. I did not feel this was safe. Read release paperwork they used to fly aircraft home and noticed it only stated damage on inlet and core cowl; not on containment case and rub strip.  Safety needs to be top priority and follow proper procedure. I know when an aircraft is down in outstation the need to get aircraft back on line or back to base to get fixed is a big deal but we must be safe first. The release is the only paper I have seen and was the only thing used in the logbook; so unless there was some other approval to make it safe I do not feel this was safe to fly aircraft home. We took epoxy to fill holes in engine for a temporary repair; I felt this would be safe for a temporary repair to get aircraft home.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
24,24,24,24,7204,While on vectors for visual approach we were cleared to 3000 feet and on a heading to join the localizer. The heading was going to have us joining above the glide slope. The First Officer (FO) was pilot flying. He increased the descent rate to join the glide slope. The airplane did not capture the GS; so [the FO] disconnected the AP to level off and recapture. The auto throttles were not responsive; forcing him to trade a small amount of altitude for speed until we could get the throttles to respond. We selected speed in the speed window and that solved the problem. We did get below the GS; but re-intercepted and landed uneventfully. Looking back; I probably would have done a go around; but it happened very quickly and was resolved with corrective action very quickly.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

As we passed Hirtu Intersection at 9;300 FT it became increasing clear that we were too high to continue the approach. The First Officer called for a go-around and commenced a VFR traffic pattern to the south. I called the CTAF and advised local traffic of our intentions. While on downwind a regional flight waiting to depart advised us the DEN Center was looking for us on 120.47. I contacted DEN Center and advised the Controller of our go-around. He stated that we needed to have contacted him in a more timely manner as without our IFR cancellation he could not let another air carrier proceed to HDN.

26,26,26,26,3307,During preflight inspection; I discovered a burned out navigation light on the right wing.  I informed the Captain.  The Captain notified maintenance of the issue and he was informed that Maintenance was on their way to the aircraft.  The Captain and I continued performing duties to prepare for departure.  We had signed fit for duty and received release 0.Maintenance came aboard the aircraft and proceeded to defer the navigation light; and returned the aircraft logbook to the Captain.  The Captain and I confirmed that the logbook was filled out correctly.  We then briefed the MEL; ran the originating and receiving checklist and the before start checklist; pushed back; and departed the gate.  We later noticed that we had received a message.  It was a message from Dispatch for amendment to the release for the addition of the MEL related to the navigation light.  We realized that we had failed to communicate with the Dispatcher to receive amendment to the release.Factors contributing to our error were external pressures to be on time; and also recency of flying for the Captain.  Maintenance was still on the aircraft within a couple minutes of departure time.  I definitely was influenced by trying to depart on time.  At the time; I felt that we were being thorough.  In retrospect; I could have slowed down and made sure that all necessary steps were completed even if we took another minute or two to depart the gate.  Prior to the flight we discussed the the fact that the Captain has not had much flying recently.  He explained that he had several phone calls with the company within the couple of hours prior to the flight to ensure that he met the recent flight requirements.  This also created external pressure for him.  Also; habits can degrade after being out of the flight deck for even a couple weeks and it can be easy to miss steps especially when a distraction such as a small maintenance issue arises.  Despite this; I as the First Officer should have been able to realize and correct our error.  To avoid similar future errors; it is important to slow down and take care of minor maintenance issues a step at a time to ensure that all necessary communications with the company are accomplished.  During future similar events; I will be more aware of communications from Dispatch about amendments to the release.  Perhaps creating cues to remind myself would be helpful (such as writing a note on a piece of paper and placing it between the thrust levers or over the MCDU).,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
27,27,27,27,7904,A very bad odor was present when we boarded the plane. I am Flight Attendant Number 2. The Flight Attendant Number 4 came back and said; what is that awful smell? I said please go up and tell the Captain. The Captain came back and said the same thing. We asked to call Maintenance as it was very strong. Passengers boarded before Maintenance arrived. The Captain turned on the internal air and Jet Fumes 'Fuel Gases' came into the airplane. So strong; that the Flight Attendant Number 4 went up to the cockpit and told him to turn off the air. Passengers then deplaned and Maintenance arrived. They pulled out F/C galley carts and walked throughout the plane. They said; that they didn't smell anything. But; we 'the crew' could still get whiffs of the smell. The FAA Inspector seated in XC (he boarded before passengers); also walked through and could smell it. The Maintenance (Representative) proceeded to write it 'all clear' in the log book and we 'the flight attendants' said wait! We are calling Management and the Union. We had a FSM and The Operational Manager come to the plane. Upon entering they smelled it immediately and asked us to step onto the jetbridge. Maintenance then proceeded to re-check the plane and the FAA Inspector followed behind. As we the crew were on the jetbridge; the maintenance crew closed the aircraft door and started the APU. That is when the smell got extremely worse and filled the cockpit and cabin. It was coming out of the individual air vents in the cabin. I believe that the haste to get this plane out on time; would have caused a major health event with the passengers and crew. If the flight attendants hadn't forced the issue it would have proceeded to fly to destination. Update is that the Union verified that it was an 'Oil Leak' on the APU. This is why we shouldn't take these situations lightly and always get a second opinion! Myself 'Flight Attendant Number 2;' the Flight Attendant Number 3 and Flight Attendant Number 1 went hospital to get checked out. All (4) crewmembers had headaches and slight nausea. The Flight Attendant Number 4 had a headache and proceeded to work the new aircraft to destination. The aircraft was taken out of service.A second opinion; as well as running various tests. Don't be in a hurry if there is a distinct odor in the plane. There were 6 Crewmembers and an FAA Inspector that smelled the odor and Maintenance didn't.

28,28,28,28,3537,I went along as a passenger in my hangar neighbor's Zenith 801. It was explained by this owner/ pilot/ builder these model planes have counter intuitive characteristics to typical major certified aircraft; and though it is a STOL aircraft; it requires a good deal of power and acutely higher pitch up for proper landings. Because of this; [pilot] was practicing simulated emergency engine out landings should he ever experience and engine failure. Though riding as a passenger; I am a commercially rated pilot and CFI; so I'm filing this form for the intended purpose of this NASA safety program. Naturally these same reasons; I did not want to be acting as an instructor or crew for this flight.My observations; the first power off landing was a made with no flaps and I thought was just ideal in every way. This second power off landing; was done with some with flaps extended when the field was thought to be made; I estimate 10-degree flaps were deployed. I noted an acute reduction aspect ratio after flaps were lowered. Realizing on short final that a power off glide was going to be short; pilot said: 'perhaps I should go around' and introduced power; plane then quickly achieved what appeared the needed glide path; it looked ideal; and he said; 'I think I will try to make this work'. Unfamiliar with this plane; sight picture would seem very reasonable. Pilot continued his power off glide toward the runway with similar AOA as previous landing. As we approached close to flare altitude; I looked over to notice airspeed indicator at 54 mph and falling rapidly! Alarmed by the rapid deceleration; I yelled 'power!' by that time indicator was passing though 50mph.There was a throttle on my side of the airplane; but since I was not acting as a pilot or instructor and for the unfamiliarity of this aircraft; I thought it safer and only appropriate to only advise the observation of critical airspeed decay; so I didn't consider counter control input or trying to add power myself.The pilot dropped the nose and added power to recover; from my experience in certified aircraft; for a balked landing I would have added power and pulled the nose up; but this Zenith 801 is so different I thought best to only alert the pilot the urgency to take action for the decaying airspeed. There was some mild wind gust; and we were in the unfortunate phase of those gust as well. After exhaustive thought; for the unusual flight characteristics of this Zenith 801 with flaps deployed; I still cannot say definitively what the correct correction of pitch should have been for this situation of low airspeed and low altitude for this aircraft. [Pilot] is a very conscientious and exemplary pilot; I'm inclined to believe that this experimental model aircraft with flaps deployed; may simply be inherently hazardous for power off landings. Perhaps this could be very useful in advising other similar experimental owners; builders; and pilots of this designs insidious power off characteristics.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
29,29,29,29,26,I was the IRO on [this flight]. Arriving into KIAH; the controller cleared our flight to descend via the MSCOT2 RNAV arrival. He subsequently assigned us to fly at 300 KIAS which is 20 knots above the published speed of 280 KIAS on the STAR. The crew flew the arrival in the LNAV/VNAV mode. The controller asked the crew to keep our speed up as long as possible. At MSCOT the aircraft leveled off at 10;000 feet and began slowing to 250 KIAS. The controller immediately queried the crew as to why we were slowing. He stated that he intended for us to keep up our speed till DOMNO due to following traffic. He immediately issued S turn to following traffic. The flying pilot then disconnected the autopilot and continued to descend though 10;000 feet increasing our speed. We were flying 290 down to 8000 feet when we began to slow to 250. There was a lack of communication between ATC and the crew. The ATC controller assumed we would continue to DOMNO before we descended through 10;000 feet and slowed. The crew left the aircraft in VNAV and allowed it to begin slowing at MSCOT. The clearance from ATC to keep our speed up was not definitive.

34,34,34,34,7238,Two company maintenance technicians were assigned to move an empty aircraft from the International Terminal to the Domestic Terminal for an outbound flight. One Mechanic had just entered aircraft as the other unplugged the jetway power in preparation for a high speed tow operation. Just as the Mechanic detached the power cord; a gust of wind caused the aircraft to 'weather vane' at the gate. The aircraft pivoted on the main landing gear and the nose of the aircraft went into an uncontrolled excursion of between twenty five and forty feet. Neither Mechanic was injured. The main gear and nose gear were all chocked. The main gear chocks were simply displaced by the tires. The nose gear chocks were not displaced; but had no effect on the lateral movement of the [aircraft] excursion. The aircraft was removed from revenue service and taken to a hangar for inspection. This is the third incidence in several months of company aircraft 'weather vaning' at a gate. A previous incident pulled an attached tow tractor along with the aircraft. My Air Carrier has a new policy of 'brakes off;' when an aircraft is in a gate. Most other air carriers do not allow brakes off at a gate. My Air Carrier has only recently instituted such a policy in order to facilitate a faster movement of aircraft without the necessity of a person in the cockpit. It may work fine in [some locations]; but should not be promoted in [very] windy locations. My Air Carrier says they have a policy of setting the brakes in high winds; but these conditions are transient and conditional; and therefore have no place as a policy when adverse weather conditions pop up at random times.

35,35,35,35,94,An Instructor [and I] departed for ZZZ. I am a Private pilot who is getting back into flying after [a] break and have recently started working on my Instrument Rating. We filed IFR to ZZZ. Weather at the time of departure was marginal VFR in ZZZ and about 9;000 OVC 6+ SM visibility in ZZZ1 which was our alternate. TAF was showing no change to the METAR for the time of arrival. I had the FBO fill the Piper Arrow before we departed. Weather was IFR when we departed and we quickly came out on top to find VFR conditions the entire enroute phase of flight. I do recall stronger head winds than anticipated during this phase of flight and commented on the additional time and fuel we would burn. As we proceeded over [a mountain peak]; I could see into the valley and noticed low level clouds that appeared to be very thick. We contacted ZZZ1 approach for vectors to the RNAV RWY XX. As we descended in the approach the clouds were very thick and we shot a missed approach deciding to go to ZZZ1. [We were] put into a hold for approximately 25 minutes. [An air carrier] flight shot the approach and landed. At this point; we decided to follow them and try the RNAV RWY YY approach. As we approached MDA [minimum descent altitude]; I noticed the ground becoming visible through the cloud base and saw the approach lights (Rabbits). I relayed this information to my Instructor; however; he could not see anything and made the decision to go missed. After shooting the missed approach into ZZZ1; we were low on fuel and decided to go to ZZZ2 where weather was showing more favorable conditions. As ATC was vectoring us to RNAV RWY ZZ into ZZZ2; we needed additional time to prepare and get the approach into the Garmin. At this time; we did a 360 and reestablished ourselves on the approach. Upon final approach we started to lose our engine due to fuel exhaustion. I turned on the fuel pump and switched tanks and the engine was fine. A few minutes after that; the engine quit and we were out of fuel about a half mile from the runway end. I could see the runway but it was evident that we did not have the altitude to make an on airport landing. We noticed a field to the left of us and make a safe landing in the field. Aircraft was not damaged and no one was hurt.Contributing factors to this incident include:As a [Instrument] Student Pilot; I was not familiar with this aircraft. The checklist said to fill the tanks to the tabs. That is what I did. I know now that this is for storing the aircraft; but you can top the tanks in cross country. Estimated flight time was 1:50.We knew we were operating into our reserve fuel and should have not held for so long to get into ZZZ1. ZZZ2 would have been a better decision. Weather was not forecast to be this poor and ATC said it had rolled in unexpectedly about 15 minutes prior to us arriving.Stronger than anticipated head winds in route.Unable to land at destination airport.Extensive time holding to shoot the approach into ZZZ1.Unable to land at the alternate airport ZZZ1. After not being able to land in ZZZ1; we were Minimum fuel. We should have declared an emergency and taken vectors directly to ZZZ2.

36,36,36,36,9015,Descending on the [arrival] into ZZZ about 70 NM out; we retrieved the updated ATIS as well as the METAR. Both indicated a tailwind exceeding limits into ZZZ on Runway 30. Winds were indicating about a 13 kt. tailwind. Pilot Monitoring asked NorCal approach if ZZZ was going to change runways to Runway XX since the winds were out of limits for Runway XY. They said they would ask and to continue on the Runway XY transition. We were switched over to another NorCal frequency and they asked what our limit was and we told them 10 kts. Approach reported ZZZ Tower said the winds were 120 at 9 knots and to continue to Runway XY. Eventually cleared ILS Runway XY and broke out into visual conditions about 2;500 ft. MSL. We had [weather] up and were monitoring the tailwind as well as asking for multiple wind checks from Tower. [Weather] showed a tailwind from 18-20 kts. all the way down final to include 150 ft. AGL where a go-around was initiated. During this time; ZZZ Tower kept reporting surface winds 120 at 9 knots. Tower recognized our going around and directed to fly runway heading and maintain 2;000 ft. The Pilot Flying hit TOGA and applied thrust to climb away and called for flaps 15. Pilot Monitoring moved the flaps to 15 and responded back to Tower.At this point the aircraft was accelerating and the Pilot Flying called for flaps 5 and Pilot Monitoring repeated and moved the flaps. The same with flaps 1. About 1;000 ft.; we realized we had not placed the gear up; so we did so at this point. During this time Pilot Monitoring had to make multiple radio calls to ZZZ to confirm they wanted us runway heading instead of the published missed approach which was different. Once we got cleaned up; we were cleared to 5;000 ft. and placed on a heading back to Runway XY. Once everything had calmed down; we realized we performed the incorrect procedure for the go-around and had cleaned up the aircraft fully prior to 1;000 ft. We debriefed the procedure and what we needed to do to mitigate the risks and ensure correct procedures in the future. We then started setting up for the next approach. At this point; the aircraft behind us on approach to Runway XY went around as well. Pilot Monitoring called NorCal and asked them again if the runway was going to be switched to Runway XX. They were not sure and said it's Tower's decision and we might need to hold. Finally after 15 minutes of vectors; we were cleared the ILS Runway XX into ZZZ with no further incident.

Apparently there are again Lido weather issues.Suggest Lido begin a process similar to the one for SIGMETS not ingested correctly no matter what the root cause. Any weather data should be handled with redundancy in the process. Also alarming is the lack of communication about these ongoing problems in Lido.

AFE (Above Field Elevation) with advancement in override thrust. Subsequently received windshear caution. After selecting TOGA and pitch up flew flight director. No windshear escape guidance provided as the windshear was not sustained. Thrust was advanced to GA (Go-Around) RSV as a precaution. Stable in the missed approach maneuver with no caution windshear; PF called Flaps 4 due to flaps full configured. Gear retracted at a safe altitude with positive climb rate. Flew ATC assigned runway heading with missed approach climb profile. Subsequent approach flown to the ILS profile with Flaps 5. Flew the glide slope to RWY [Runway] XXR. No windshear event occurred. Received wind report with gust factor 28 kts. Selected manual speeds to increase approach sped until 4-5 kts. until after passing 500 ft. AFE 'stable' call the target speed was reduced. Maintained visual descent rate with visual cues and instrumentation of the ILS. During round out to flare automation set the aural 'sink rate' message. FO (First Officer) announced correcting due to the aural call and confirmed with a cross check the sink rate was induced by maintaining descent rate with the descent maneuver to coupled round out pitch rate simultaneously for the landing maneuver; not due to windshear as the speed was stable. FO and CA (Captain) on debrief both acknowledged the aural alert at post flight and both agreed with given conditions the approach to landing was stable given the conditions. Touchdown was within LTP (Landing Threshold Point) distance.Second approach with Flaps 5 configuration allowed for a higher approach speed and acknowledging the wind factor with increase in target speed for gusty conditions allowed for less susceptibility for the same condition. Automation with sensor inputs from other automated systems is subject to its own set design limitations and may not reflect positive confirmation of the event with pilot judgment of the same situation monitoring the same event.

41,41,41,41,4385,On Day 2 of a 3 Day Trip; we experienced an irregular operation on our second leg; flight ZZZ-ZZZ1. The weather in ZZZ1 had deteriorated to sub-CAT 1; with low ceiling; low visibility and reports of moderate icing in the ZZZ1 terminal area. We prepared for an autoland approach to Runway XX. While established on the localizer just outside of the FAF; the preceding traffic reported that they had encountered severe icing on the same approach. We executed an early Missed Approach; climbed above the layers of icing conditions and requested delay vectors to evaluate our situation. After conferring with Dispatch via SatComm; it was jointly decided to return to ZZZ. We blocked-in to ZZZ at XA:58.Immediately following the completion of the Shutdown Checklist; I called our Dispatcher who said that based on several current PIREPS; icing conditions on the approach into ZZZ1 had improved from severe to moderate; and that we would be dispatched once again to ZZZ1 (we had received an ACARS message to this effect during our descent into ZZZ).However; as soon the L1 door opened (and while I was on the phone with Dispatch); the Customer Service Representative apparently announced that our flight had been cancelled. Passengers started to deplane... I relayed the information to our Dispatcher who confirmed that we would be flying back to ZZZ1. I made a PA to this effect; apologized for the confusion; jumped out of my seat and tried to inform those that had already made it to the jetway that we would be departing back for ZZZ1 once refueled.As has been my experience with past diversions; a few problems seem to reoccur: the flight paperwork cannot be retrieved; and the load manifest can take a long time to reconcile. This 'splash and go' took precisely 1h30min to accomplish!We finally blocked out at XC:28... While taxiing out at a slow speed (less than 10 kts.); I had to do an EMERGENCY STOP to avoid an airport operations vehicle driving at an estimated 40-50 mph southbound; outside of the vehicle road; rotating beacon flashing and headed right for us. Close call and narrowly avoided collision there! This vehicle had not seen us; made an emergency stop followed by a 180deg turn and stopped.Our flight to ZZZ1 was uneventful and concluded with an autoland on Runway XY. We blocked in at XD:37. Thanks to the ZZZ1 station contacting our hotel; transportation arrived promptly. I went to bed at XF:00.Our morning Report Time was adjusted to XN:52 for our departure to ZZZ. We got de-iced (it was snowing) and flew back to ZZZ.Upon arrival after an uneventful flight; my F/O and I had a discussion about fatigue.

We decided that it was not smart to continue our day as planned: a flight to ZZZ2; close to 3hrs of ground time; and then ZZZ2-ZZZ3.Our fatigue call was the result of an unforeseen irregular operation and didn't have much to do with pairing construction. We had pushed ourselves hard during our second flight to ZZZ1; which concluded by an autoland in low IFR on a contaminated runway with potentially adverse icing conditions on the approach.

With the fuel pump on; mixture rich; and starter turning; the right engine caught fire. Several people on the ground; and the test engineer in the right seat saw it and notified me. Again; by memory and not in-line with normal POH (Pilot's Operating Handbook) procedure I put the mixture at idle cutoff without continuing to crank the engine with the starter. I also did not first move the fuel selector to OFF. The fire went out almost immediately after pulling the mixture to idle cutoff and we exited the airplane without further incident.Lessons learned...practice memory items. I did not act in accordance with the POH for the condition and we were lucky the fire went out and didn't cause any damage. Think about the procedure before you do it. Leaning the mixture on descent hadn't been needed previously in this aircraft; but with the new pumps; it was. It was something that I did not remedy with the landing checklist since the previous fuel pumps did not need leaning or enriching below 8;000 FT. So when the checklist called for 'Mixtures - Rich' I just by rote; completed that item without checking.

During cruise flight the FOB (Fuel On Board) and the Fuel Quantity numbers at first showed double lines in the last two digits of the fuel numbers; indicating that the Fuel Quantity System was operating in a degraded mode. Shortly after; the FOB [and] the fuel quantity indicators in the right hand fuel tanks and one fuel temperature indicator in the right hand tank showed all amber XX's. Center tank showed the double lines. Left hand tank indications became erratic changing quantities indicated. Fuel prediction numbers were different between the two FMGC's (Flight Management and Guidance Computers) and became erratic including prediction landing below minimum fuel. No ECAM alerts at any point during entire event. I; as Captain; tasked the FO (First Officer) with flying the airplane and continuing our deviations around thunderstorms and working with ATC. I reviewed the QRH Fuel tab and non ECAM sections. I quickly looked at any non-normal procedures [and] I looked at fuel systems. Finding nothing; I discussed with the FO for any ideas. I had him look for guidance in our reference materials. We did look at and review the Fuel Leak procedure under the Fuel tab of the QRH because as the event progressed we had the landing fuel below minimums message. We had the flight attendants look for a fuel leak visually out the windows and [asked] if they smelled fuel; they did not see or smell any fuel leak. I then sent an ACARS message to dispatch to expect an ARINC phone patch from me. I contacted Dispatch via ARINC and a phone patch. I asked to talk to [Operations]. After being on hold; I was able to discuss this issue with [Operations] to ask for any guidance for some procedure I might have missed. They had no additional information to add. I then asked to be connected to [our] Program manager and was told they couldn't do that. I then told dispatch that we felt the safest course of action was to divert. They agreed. During this time we were fairly confident that we didn't have a major fuel leak or fuel system problem but couldn't be sure since we could not tell fuel quantities. We felt the safest course of action was to divert at that time. We worked through this entire process fairly quickly. [The divert airport] was a straight shot; clear of weather and gave us just enough time and distance to descend. During the descent the fuel quantities indications returned to normal and fuel numbers seemed reasonable with our 'rough math'/flight plan for time enroute. We were able to feel confident in performance numbers and landing distances using those numbers. We landed and taxied to the gate uneventfully. Maintenance under the direction of [Operations] powered down the aircraft and reapplied power and cleared the discrepancy that way. After further review; away from the stress of the situation; I was able to find a possible solution to this issue. Going almost page by page of the QRH I found that [the aircraft] does have a computer reset for Fuel Quantity indications that is allowed during flight. Personally I am very hesitant to reset circuit breakers in flight and therefore it wasn't a section of the QRH I would automatically look at during flight. Also I believe that that in the Fuel tab of the QRH it should have a reference to the fact that this reset existed. This reset is not available on all our aircraft. Both myself and my FO on the flight didn't know that that reset was available to us. I have informally asked a few other pilots; captains and FOs and no one else knew of that reset or said that that was somewhere they would have looked at during flight. It's not in bold print in the Computer Resets table.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
45,45,45,45,2864,Climbing through about FL180; we got an ENG 2 ANTI ICE Fail message followed by the warning ice condition ANTI ICE inoperative. Previous reports told us that ice would stop at FL220. Since we knew that ice was present below us to about 12000 feet; we kept climbing as we completed the QRH. Got on top of the ice as we finished the QRH. The engine vibrations were normal so we had no intent to shut down the engine. I called dispatch to discuss a plan. I asked if there were any areas of no ice that were close and it was determined that there were no areas close enough. In concurrence with dispatch; we decided to divert. Notified ourselves as an emergency with ATC and stated our diversion intent. Notified Flight Attendants and passengers.  ATC then asked us to descend to 220. We asked to stay at 250 until we could get a decent below the freezing level. The First Officer and I discussed the emergency descent procedure. We decided that speed brakes and landing gear out were not good ideas in moderate ice. We got a descent to 9000. We descended in a clean configuration at 270 knots. We sped up to 300 knots to increase the descent rate. As we approached 11000 feet; we were still in clouds with negative temperatures. I notified ATC that we would be coming through 10000 in excess of 250 knots until we got out of ice. ATC responded that it would be no problem. As we came thru 10000; we started slowing to respect the aircraft limitation. Positive temperatures were encountered around 9000 feet and we were at 250 knots around 8500 feet. Got down to 5000 feet and burned off the gas to land at or below landing weight. Uneventful from that point until at the gate. Got another airplane and continued to destination.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

47,47,47,47,2413,As we accepted the aircraft for its first flight of the day; we noticed that the APU was deferred.  Everything else was deemed normal with the aircraft and operations for that morning.  We were cleared for takeoff...  Everything proceeded as normal until we were at about 600 feet AGL in the climbout; just after gear retraction.   We received a Master Caution; GEN 2 OFF.  [I] proceeded to reach up to the overhead panel and reset what [I] thought was the GEN 2 switch at around 1;000 feet AGL.  [I] had accidentally selected GEN 1 and placed the switch from OFF to ON/RESET.  This action caused the aircraft to auto-deploy the ADG; also causing a host of caution messages on the EICAS.  [I]; realizing [my] error; then reset GEN 2; the proper generator.  Certain components that had fallen offline from the power disruption were now reset. First Officer then asked Departure Control for a level off to 6;000 feet; rather than continuing our climb and stated to Departure Control that we had an issue that we were working on.  First Officer then asked for autopilot engagement and called for the QRH Procedures for GEN 2 OFF.  I then indicated to him that we should also run the procedure for INADVERTENT ADG DEPLOYMENT since I had made an error in selecting the wrong generator for a reset.  The GEN 2 OFF checklist ultimately had us monitoring the electrical loads on the schematic page; which indicated that everything was now being powered in a normal manner (except for the ADG being deployed) by both generators.  Since this was a normal power distribution; we then elected NOT to declare an emergency. The INADVERTENT ADG DEPLOYMENT checklist ultimately had us push the Power Transfer Override switch.  A climb checklist was then run to make sure that nothing was missed. After a quick discussion we both then decided it was best to return to [departure airport] at that point. We landed safely.  Later that day; on the subsequent climbout we received a GEN 2 OFF master caution again at 600 feet.  We continued the climbout as normal.  First Officer asked for autopilot engagement and called for the GEN 2 OFF QRH Procedure.  I then ran the procedure and then generator reset properly without any further abnormalities.  I realize that there were things I could've done better to prevent this situation from occurring.  My first mistake came from reacting much too quickly to the GEN 2 OFF master caution.  A contributing factor may have been that I was hyper-sensitive to the fact that we didn't have an APU gen online at the time and were down to only one gen with the GEN 2 OFF master caution.  Proper technique is to wait until you're at a safe altitude and call for the QRH- GEN 2 OFF master caution.  Also; I should've verified with First Officer Baker the proper gen switch before moving it.  When the issue happened again on the subsequent takeoff; I had learned my lesson (the hard way) and much care and time was taken in calling for the appropriate checklist; verifying the appropriate gen switch and not rushing into the situation.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
48,48,48,48,5877,Our aircraft had a write-up from the previous crew concerning the Rudder Ratio system. The write up in the log book had been signed off. We had the identical Rudder Ratio problem develop after take off. I wrote up the problem on arrival. It then took me about 1:20 to get from the aircraft; clear Customs; go through security; get the new release; check weather; and make my way back out to the aircraft. Maintenance had already been to the aircraft and signed off my log book entry. My First Officer told me that the mechanic explained that the previous maintenance work had not cleared the fault messages and this was the probable cause for the recurrence. We again took off and the Rudder Ratio message reappeared. During climb; the First Officer (pilot flying) noted that; with a computed 11 knot crosswind; it had taken an abnormal amount of rudder to maintain runway alignment. What this implied to me was that this was more than just a nuisance alert; it was an indication that we were failed in the high speed mode.I attempted to communicate with Dispatch to determine if they wanted us to return; but the responses I was getting indicated that they did not understand that it was a Rudder Ratio failure and not just a Rudder Ratio light failure. After considering that the aircraft would be shot down at our foreign destination; probably needing at least parts to be flown in for repair; and that the runway is relatively short and narrow with rising terrain nearby to the south; I decided that to continue would pose an unacceptable risk and that returning to our departure airport was our best option.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I told the Captain he needs to go straight out and not make the turn but he was adamant about making a right turn. Now we were heading down Taxiway J which is Ramp Control's area. Ground Control told us we should have gone straight out like I advised the Captain to do. We were given instructions to go to Spot Y then join Taxiway K for Runway 9L.

50,50,50,50,5347,[We were] cleared for the visual approach near PENCL Intersection for Runway 10 at ATL. The autopilot was on and we were flying a heading of 070 degrees to join the final approach coarse and descending to 4;000 FT. Sky was clear and visibility unrestricted. Prior to localizer coming alive; we were slightly high on the glideslope. I reset the altitude alerter and selected vertical speed on the flight control panel in order to keep our descent going to capture the glideslope. In the meantime; the localizer started to center up. With the preoccupation of the glideslope; I either did not select APPR mode; or did not press the button hard enough to arm the APPR mode. We flew through the localizer; at which point the Captain stated that we were not armed for the approach. He disconnected the autopilot and turned the aircraft back to join the final approach course. We received a Traffic Alert as we were turning back to the localizer. The Approach Controller then advised a turn to the localizer after we had initiated our turn and pointed out traffic on the parallel Runway; 9R. We intercepted the LOC and landed with no further incident. This was the last leg of a five leg day at the end of a three day trip. I believe the combination of everything happening at once; with the glideslope; localizer; resetting the altitude alerter and Vertical speed caused just enough of a distraction to lead to us not double checking to make sure the APPR mode was selected on the Flight Control Panel.

54,54,54,54,6523,I was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) on the leg from TEB-ZZZ. My captain briefed the RUUDY5 departure prior to departing TEB; and acknowledged the top altitude for the departure as defined by the SID (2000 FT MSL). The departure was properly loaded into our FMS.Upon receiving our takeoff clearance; the tower controller told us we were cleared to takeoff runway 24 and join the RUUDY5 departure.At 400 AGL; I followed the captain's command to pull the gear up; and was working through all associated post-takeoff PNF responsibilities. I checked in with NY departure with my altitude. NY departure acknowledged my altitude. A short time later; NY Departure questioned our altitude; as we were crossing Wentz at 2;000 feet (instead of the clearly marked 1;500 crossing restriction). NY departure calmly told us it put us in the arrivals corridor for EWR. While trying to talk to my Captain to see what the heck he was doing related to the crossing restriction; NY departure asked why we were flying the wrong course. I realized at this point that the Captain had turned on the autopilot by himself; instead of calling for the PNF to do it (me); and had incorrectly selected heading mode instead of NAV mode; and not said aloud (as required by company policy) that he had engaged the autopilot. I told the Captain he'd engaged heading and not NAV mode; and he selected NAV mode; turning us toward ZIMMZ intersection (our correct course at that point). The captain requested the SID's top altitude of 2000 be set in the altitude pre-select; instead of putting 1500 in for the intermediate level off to comply with the crossing restriction at WENTZ.The controller was polite and direct in asking why our altitudes and course were incorrect. The captain (recently retired 121) told me he hadn't understood the chart (government charts); as he was used to JEPP charts; and that he hadn't seen the intermediate crossing restriction at WENTZ (even though he briefed it correctly on the ground).,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

The traffic passed close enough to the jumpers to cause the ZAB controller some concern. Typically; traffic that is seven miles out will not be a factor at the two minute mark.

Signals got crossed and I elected to hand fly as the airplane was now climbing quite rapidly. There was some confusion on the radio as to what heading we were to fly and how the controller wanted us to return to land in the opposite direction; and the distraction of trying to get the airplane out of [go around] mode (heading select) led to an overshoot of 500 feet on the level off. We were VMC with no separation issues; and Tower did not comment except to clear us back down to 2500 feet. The Tower Controller was then pushing us to initiate a teardrop or switch back to approach for an extended downwind. PM asked for a 6 mile final; but even after we reconfigured quickly with maximum drag; we were just barely stable at 500 feet for the landing. We realized after landing that the approach speeds were not reset for the higher wind component (17 knots) on final.Expectation bias on the initial missed approach. I was thinking about a normal go around; but the Controller wanted us to perform a discontinued approach. We were already throttled up and climbing when the controller asked us to level off at a lower altitude. Too many hands were working the glare shield controls [MCP] at once; and altitude hold was not selected in a timely manner. Hand flying was then the best option; but I lost situational awareness when the conversation became about heading and missed the level off. We then let ourselves be talked into a shorter approach than we wanted after the missed approach; causing us to feel rushed to land.Decide on a course of action and stick with it. If it's going to be a normal go around; then do that. If it's going to be a discontinued approach; then make it clear to the other crewmember who will be pushing the buttons. If more time is needed after an unusual event (i.e.: go around) to get set up for another try; then take the time and don't let ATC rush the process.

57,57,57,57,4483,ILS Approach; ZZZ Tower closed. Dark night with overcast. Active cell with heavy precipitation. Wind reported 350@12. Coming from the southwest; we requested and were given direct ZZZZZ; descend to 7000. The active cell over ZZZZZ had us divert left. After clearing the cell; we were instructed to turn right heading 070; then turn left 350 to intercept the localizer; descend and maintain 5300 until established; cleared for the approach. We verified the 5300 altitude with ATC. Level at 5300; course alive between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1; we got a terrain caution followed by a terrain pull up alert. Pilot [Flying] (First Officer) immediately disconnected the autopilot; climbed and Pilot Monitoring (Captain) advised ATC. We leveled-off at 6500 and re-engaged the auto-pilot in ALT and HDG modes. ATC vectored us to the west. After discussing the incident with ATC; they indicated the minimum vectoring altitude in the area is 5300. Captain checked sufficient fuel on board for a second attempt. Not sure if the terrain warning was erroneous after the minimum vectoring altitude discussion and reviewing the terrain information on the approach chart; we requested and got vectors back to final. We were instructed to descend and maintain 5300 once again. On a heading of 150 while being vectored and descending to 5300 we had another terrain pull up alert. Pilot Flying disconnected the autopilot and immediately initiated a climb to a safe altitude and Pilot Monitoring advised ATC. After re-engaging the auto-pilot in ALT and HDG modes at about 6300 ft. we had another discussion with ATC regarding minimum vectoring altitude. We were then vectored to intercept the localizer and capture the glide slope between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 but closer to ZZZZZ this time (the cell over ZZZZZ was still active). We asked ATC to maintain our altitude until established. We intercepted the localizer and glide slope at 6300 ft. and performed a visual approach backed-up with the ILS to an uneventful landing. Landed with > 4000lbs of fuel on board (tankering). At no time was any aircraft limitation exceeded. This report is erroneously indicating it was a non-revenue flight when it was a revenue flight. After further review on a sectional chart; highest terrain in the area is at 3;457 ft.; left of localizer between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1. A minimum vectoring altitude of 5300 ft. put us 1843 ft. above the terrain. Had the cell not be present over ZZZZZ; we would have intercepted the localizer further out and at a higher altitude and probably would not have received any terrain warnings. Minimum crossing altitude is 5500 at ZZZZZ and 5000 at ZZZZZ1. Add more detailed terrain information on the approach chart.

A few minutes later ATC queried where we were going as he showed us off course and we should have been going to AALLE instead.  The First Officer re-programmed that into the FMC and I confirmed it.  11;000 was still a good lowest altitude and the flight path vector showed us not to our top of descent yet so we were on path.  I'm not sure ATC knows how to pronounce AALLE properly because the way he said it; it sounded like FLAIL.  Both AALLE and FLAIL sound very similar; especially when you are in a loud cockpit.

59,59,59,59,9066,Our flight was originally assigned the WILBR4 Arrival into DFW. Near LIT ATC reassigned us on the SEEVR1 and cleared us direct RRNET. We were then told to descend to FL260. Just prior to SWTCH intersection we were cleared to 'Descend via the BRDJE1; delete the speeds except comply beginning at SEEVR.' We had SEEVR1 in the GFMS and on our iPads and; as the Pilot Flying I noticed I had to rush to comply with the crossing restriction at THEMM (between FL230 and FL210). I began a descent and was at FL230 before I realized we had been reassigned to the BRDJE1 and had the wrong arrival programmed into the GFMS. I crossed TUSLE intersection at FL230; 3000 feet low; and then resumed the BRDJE1 Arrival without further incident. Many of the RNAV Arrivals into DFW have the same names for fixes with vastly different crossing restrictions. Were SEEVR intersection assigned a different name for the BRDJE1 Arrival; that would have not matched up with what I was seeing on my iPad or on the GFMS and would have clued me in on the reassignment when ATC told us to 'comply beginning at SEEVR.'

65,65,65,65,3151,Coming into IAD the errors started when we were intercepting the localizer for Runway 1R. I was the pilot monitoring and the FO (First Officer) was the pilot flying. Approach cleared us to intercept when we were basically already crossing the final approach course so we had to navigate back to the localizer on our own. At the same time we had been getting hit with some minor wake turbulence from the airplane ahead of us which Approach informed us was a Boeing 777. We were then cleared for the visual approach and advised of the caution for wake turbulence and to maintain 170 kts. until 5 miles out. At this time we configured gear down flaps 20. I had just recently had training in the sim for wake turbulence and remembered how dangerous it could be so I advised my FO to use caution and I believe I recommended maybe staying above their path since we had already hit a small portion of their wake prior when we were on downwind. He elected to turn the autopilot off and hand fly slightly above their glide path. We then continued down and around 100 ft. got a terrain warning. Our first reaction was this was because we weren't on glide path and the FO called out; 'visual; landing.' around 50 ft. we got another aural message stating 'too low terrain'; at this point I realized something was wrong and quickly scanned and noticed we were still at flaps 20. At this point I immediately called for a balked landing. The FO restated in a question; balked landing? I said yes and he immediately executed the maneuver. We advised ATC of the go around and they asked for the reasoning and I stated we were unstable. We continued the go around and came back to land on [Runway] 1R after some vectoring without further incident. To add to this and to summarize; we did not complete a landing checklist; we were not fully configured and were at gear down flaps 20 degrees; and our speed bug was still at 170 kts. We received a terrain aural warning that we misinterpreted followed by a second aural warning and executed a balked landing at a medium energy state with lower power setting but high airspeed. Our attention started deviating from standard starting with the poor intercept angle of the localizer. I further complicated the situation by over concentrating on the wake turbulence from the 777 and focusing too much on the FO's glide path and what I would call tunnel focusing on his flying. I believe my statements to him about the wake turbulence also led to distracting him from normal flight operations as well. He was talking through his thought process on staying a half dot high on the glide path and I was responding with statements like I agree; not necessarily breaking sterile cockpit but also causing more distraction on both of our parts. This was the first time that I had not completed a landing checklist. It has made me realize that while being aware of threats like wake turbulence is important; it's even more important to maintain a greater situational awareness and take a step back and not tunnel focus on one threat while other threats could arise. While I am glad we did not try to force a landing. This is a mistake I never thought would be possible or would happen to me.

An airspeed call was made and flight path and airspeed where both corrected. A go around was not ordered or initiated and landing was normal. At the gate we determined that a go around was required due to night operation.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
68,68,68,68,7638,Taxing out from transient parking at VIS for a VFR flight; I transmitted on the CTAF (123.05) asking if any traffic was in the pattern at Visalia. There was no reply; and no traffic was seen flying over the airport. I then announced that I would taxi to Runway 12 for a right downwind departure; and again; no other reply was heard. The winds were out of the west at 6 KTS and favoring Runway 30; but I elected to use 12 for departure since the performance requirements for my aircraft were less than half of the usable runway length with 5 KTS of tailwind component factored in. Arriving at the hold short line; I checked my aircraft configuration for takeoff and again transmitted on the CTAF that I was taking Runway 12 for a right downwind departure. I visually check both directions as I entered the runway environment and noticed no other airplanes. Lining up; I verified my HSI matched the runway heading and then selected full power for takeoff. At this point; my scan was primarily on the instrument panel per my company's training procedures; checking power indications; engine indications and verifying airspeed. At 100 KTS; I began the rotation when I immediately noticed another aircraft rolling the opposite direction on the Runway (30); offset to the far right side of the Runway. I estimate the horizontal distance between us at 1;000 FT and my aircraft was already airborne at this point. Climbing upwind; I made another call on the CTAF announcing my position and intention to depart on the right downwind. Turning toward the downwind I verified that my radio was set to the correct frequency (123.05) and that my squelch and volume were set correctly. The checks confirmed that they were. I then asked for a radio check and was immediately validated by who I believe was the airport FBO; verifying that my transmissions were loud and clear. No other transmissions were received on the frequency before I switched over to Fresno Approach. The entire flight previous and subsequent to the incident indicated no radio problems on my aircraft. I believe the other aircraft was either on the wrong frequency or was experiencing radio problems. I also have do not recall seeing any landing or recognition lights illuminated on the aircraft; limiting its visibility. Because I did not see it prior to rotation; I cannot say whether or not it was landing or attempting to depart. For my part; I know that I made three distinct radio calls announcing my intentions prior to entering the runway environment. I also had my landing; taxi; and strobe lights illuminated upon entering the runway environment per my company's operations specifications. I checked both directions prior to entering the runway environment as has been standard in my training and procedures since my initial student pilot training. Having gone through those procedures and having no indication of conflicting traffic upon entering the runway environment; I considered my position to be 'sterile' or safe and focused on the in-cockpit tasks of the takeoff roll; only glancing up occasionally to maintain runway center-line. The incident could have been prevented if the other aircraft had been making appropriate traffic calls on the CTAF for VIS. Aside from that; it would have likely been avoided if I had taxied to Runway 30 for departure; but given the information I had visually and via the CTAF; I had no indication that a Runway 12 departure would be anything less than perfectly safe with extremely wide margins for performance.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
69,69,69,69,5257,I met a guy who wanted me to come fly with him in his personal Helicopter. The plan was for me to be there for area familiarization and as a safety pilot. I made phone calls to ZZZ tower and ZZZ1 AFB Tower to ask if that would be alright; both towers confirmed we could go out and orbit the area. I also called Company X to see if we may be able to land at the speedway since they had exclusive control of the helicopter pads for the night. Company X let me know that they did not approve. I met up with him (owner of the aircraft) that night. After talking with him; he told me he had spoken with someone from Company X and the CEO of Company X (event promoter) and had received permission to land. I took his word and we departed the ramp at ZZZ. We went out to the speedway and orbited for approximately 10 minutes. We then made a call to request to land with ZZZ1 Tower. We were told landing was at our own risk and proceeded in. After we landed the owner and two other passengers stayed at the speedway. I ferried the helicopter back to ZZZ. I then shut down the helicopter and checked my phone. I had received a text message asking me to bring his three friends to the ZZZ2 airport. His friends assured me that they were also supposed to go out to the Speedway. Since I was not paid for the flight I agreed to take them. Upon arrival at the speedway I was told to shut down by Company X Employees and that they had the police on the way since I had made an unauthorized landing. After talking with them and Metro police we came to the conclusion that the helicopter owner had not received clearance to land there. I had no intention of making an unauthorized landing and truly believed I was okay to land there. [Company named removed] employees had made it clear to me that we did not have permission to land and were concerned for the safety of their helicopters/Pilots going in and out of the landing site. They let me know that all of their pilots had received a safety training on landing at the site and that they were coordinating parking; landing and takeoff on a discrete frequency. Since I was not aware of the frequency I was potentially adding unnecessary risk to flight safety to all who were using the landing site.I believe I should have confirmed clearance to land at the site since I had earlier been told no by Company X. I had no reason to believe the man was not completely honest with me. I was not able to contact him during the several hours I was talking with Company X and law enforcement to get clarification. I was allowed to take the helicopter back to the ramp at ZZZ were I left it.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

72,72,72,72,371,I was working Yorktown sector 50. I had aircraft Y on route direct WOZEE which takes the route of flight a few miles from sector 39. Sector 39 flashed me aircraft X climbing from 36;000 feet to 38;000 feet. Aircraft Y and aircraft X were traffic; so I called sector 39 and had him tell aircraft X to be level in 2 minutes or less referencing aircraft Y with a display of the traffic placed on sector 39's radar scope and the sector 39 controller acknowledged.My first instinct was to have aircraft stop at 36;000 feet; but I assessed aircraft X's climb rate when the handoff was initiated to me and determined his rate of climb would be sufficient to be level well within 2 minutes or less. After my coordination with sector 39 with the control instruction; I then took the handoff on aircraft X. A minute or two passed and I noticed aircraft X's climb rate diminishing. I then turned aircraft Y 30 degrees right; but did not do so in enough time to keep separation. I called sector 39 back and asked if aircraft X had reported level; but did not receive a response from the sector 39 controller. I elected a turn to the right because the upper level winds were from the west northwest and thought the aircraft would turn a little quicker with the help of the wind.After the turn was initiated; aircraft Y reported getting an RA and had the traffic in sight. I then advised my supervisor of the situation. When I was relieved from the position; my supervisor stated he had listened to the tapes and that I had called sector 39 with the control instruction approximately 3 1/2 minutes before separation was lost. My supervisor stated that as soon as I hung up from Sector 39 with the control instruction; the sector 39 controller immediately told aircraft X to be level within 2 minutes or less with pilot concurrence. At some point; the pilot of aircraft X reported he was a little heavy and wasn't going to make the 2 minute restriction. The sector 39 controller advised the pilot that was okay. No coordination was ever given to me with that information. Had the sector 39 controller done so; I could have turned aircraft Y a little sooner and the sector 39 controller could have turned aircraft X and separation could have been maintained.If I receive a call from a controller advising me of a control instruction; if I or the pilot cannot make that work; I would immediately call the controller back and advise that could not be accomplished and to come up with a different course of action. Secondly; if someone is going to climb or descend an aircraft close to another controllers boundary; take a little initiative and look at the receiving controllers traffic to see if there are any conflicts.

73,73,73,73,1988,Descending on the CAPSS2 RNAV arrival into DCA. Airplane crossed HOYAS about 400 feet high. This particular STAR gave the FMC a lot of problems. Multiple alerts displayed; unnecessary airspeed changes and finally an impossible descent rate to make the HOYAS altitude restriction were all part of the descent from WAVES. Between HOYAS and CAPSS the FMC reverted to VNAV speed and simply left the path. The VNAV path alternated between an add power segment back to a flight idle; speed brakes segment several times. A better solution for the FMC is to simply average the path. Is this RNAV arrival too complex for the FMC brain? The promise of a reduced cockpit workload by using VNAV/FMC RNAV descents is elusive. Cockpit workload in this situation is increased due to crews having to constantly monitor; intervene; and fix VNAV issues.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
74,74,74,74,9246,I was in the tower cab but not working a position. The winds began to increase and the Local Controller determined a runway change was needed to Runway 12. Coordination was accomplished with the Approach Controller and along with the runway change; an opposite direction practice approach to Runway 30R was approved. Aircraft X was continuing inbound on base for Runway 12L and turned final; as Aircraft Y joined the final to Runway 30R. There was a controller change in progress as Aircraft X turned final and Aircraft Y was joining the final outside the marker. The new controller took the position as Aircraft Y checked on frequency. Local Control told Aircraft Y to continue; and that he would call his turn to circle. I reminded Local Control that he needed to call traffic and instruct Aircraft Y where to turn ('continue' does not deconflict opposite direction operations in the event of a go-around and doesn't comply with our orders). Though communication appeared difficult at times with the pilot of Aircraft Y; he circled as instructed and landed without incident. After the event; I realized that this kind of Opposite Direction Operation (both aircraft getting radar services) did not involve anyone needing priority and if I understand correctly; should not have been approved. Simply waiting a couple minutes until the first arrival (Aircraft X) landed; and then approving an 'Opposite Flow' approach to Runway 30R for Aircraft Y; would have avoided the Opposite direction Operation (ODO) situation and mitigated a lot of the associated risks. In the future; good communication and planning from the tower side in this kind of situation may assist the approach controller in positioning the opposite flow aircraft to start its practice approach as soon as opposing traffic is no longer a factor. There continues to be misunderstandings and a disconnect between facilities and controllers within our facility about what the requirements are for opposite direction and opposite flow operations. Many controllers have expressed frustration trying to understand the latest procedures; and one controller even mentioned they were not briefed on the latest requirements (scheduling issues or leave may have made a briefing difficult to accomplish).In terms of understanding ODO requirements; a challenge seems to be that the procedures have changed so many times that it is hard for controllers to keep straight the latest restrictions. And while it's important to brief everyone on new procedures; retaining the information from a briefing can be challenging for situations that we not always practice regularly (eg. ODO). Retention of new information such as this might be enhanced by having safety discussions regularly which should include reviewing events (such as the one above) and doing interactive tabletop exercises to practice techniques and methods for resolving similar traffic scenarios in the future. One of the key elements that helps me keep ODO straight in my mind is understanding the distinction of ODO versus opposite FLOW. The bottom line I've concluded is there better be a darn good reason (emergency/priority) I'm telling an approach controller that ODO for two aircraft receiving radar services is approved. However; if a pilot is requesting practice approaches or doesn't need priority; it's important for us to understand that we don't have to deny them service (workload permitting); but opposite FLOW approaches can be coordinated such that an ODO situation doesn't arise (no opposing traffic on the final or departing). I've seen controllers here provide outstanding; commendable service to pilots multiple times by working in an opposite flow operation when traffic permits. My advice to controllers is that if you're too busy on position to mentally go over the ODO requirements and how to comply with them; then opposite direction and opposite flow operations should not be approved at that time. Controllers often have egos and/or want to provide the best service to our pilots; but when in doubt; we must err to the side of caution to mitigate safety risks and prevent further ODO-related incidents in the future.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
75,75,75,75,7460,I was working alone in the tower cab; all combined tower and approach positions; at the beginning of a midshift. Weather had been moving through the area with gusty winds and precipitation in the area. I had one other aircraft on approach on another frequency. First in sequence Aircraft X checked on descending via the SADYL and immediately reported moderate turbulence. The radar depicted that weather may be better with a slight vector to the west; and such a vector would also provide the appropriate sequence to make Aircraft X follow the first aircraft.I issued a clearance to the fix JIMMI as a vector for sequence; with a descent to 9000 feet. The instruction was read back correctly and I observed Aircraft X turn left toward the fix and continued descending. I obtained some additional information from Aircraft X concerning the turbulence. At that point I went to the computer in the back of the room and logged on to the AISR website to enter a PIREP for the moderate turbulence. After successfully logging on; no more than 30 seconds; I walked back to the radar scope and observed Aircraft X descending through 8000 feet. I instructed them to climb to 9000 feet. The pilot replied they were descending to 6000 feet. I again instructed them to climb to 9000 feet and informed them that they were in a 9000 foot Minimum Vectoring Altitude Area (MVA). They began climbing and reached around 8400 feet before they crossed into a 7000 foot MVA. The 6000 altitude is the final altitude on the arrival; and I suspect they missed entering the new altitude into the FMS. A minute later they apologized for missing the altitude and said that it was due to workload in the cockpit as a result of the moderate turbulence. They landed without incident and I issued a BRASHER warning after they landed and informed them that I would need to file the associated paperwork. The responsibility to enter the PIREP into AISR instead of transmitting it verbally to FSS resulted in my being away from the radar scope as the aircraft descended through their assigned altitude. I also did not use the 'Low Altitude Alert' phraseology; but instead immediately issued the correct assigned altitude; as it felt quicker to avoid continued descent and it was the natural muscle-memory altitude instruction. In hindsight; the 'Low Altitude Alert' phraseology may have resulted in the pilots not questioning the new altitude and beginning a climb sooner.Return the responsibility of computer based PIREP entry to FSS to allow controllers and to focus on the operation.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I recently completed a Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check; but this was only the second IFR cross-country flight since then (the first was from ZZZ1 to ZZZ a few days earlier); and the first departing from a towered field. This led to my improper ATC communication procedure.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
79,79,79,79,10493,Hand flying A/P and A/T off descending from 2;400m to 1;800m while being vectored to the ILS 02R final; ATC issued a runway change to 02L. My misplaced confidence in selecting the correct EFB approach plate and making the required Baro DH change while simultaneously leveling off at 1;800m was obviously the major factor. Complicating the situation was the new EFB software. It is far from intuitive and the touch screen accuracy; despite repeated calibration; is anything but accurate. Additionally; I attempted to set the new DH while the altimeter was set for meters; further distracting me from my primary task of flying the jet. I recognized my error descending through approximately 1;770m with a max deviation of 50m (approximately 150 feet) before correcting back to 1800m. ATC soon thereafter issued a descent down to 1;200m.I have several suggestions. 1. Aviate; navigate; communicate; fly the jet first always! 2. Last minute unanticipated changes by approach control on base to final; A/P and A/T on.  3. The new EFB software is a SITUATIONAL AWARENESS black-hole. Definitely a major detractor in all flight phases. 4. Company required EFB training and self study accessible training aids totally inadequate.

80,80,80,80,3449,The tail rotor control tube was installed and the RII was performed by myself. The aircraft had been in the maintenance hangar since [the beginning for the week] for multiple inspections. After the tube was installed I was asked to complete the RII (Required Inspection Item) and verify the aft side of the tube that connects to the lower lever had proper thread count and bolt was cotter pinned. Then crawled into the tail boom compartment to verify the forward end was connected to the servo verified bolt and cotter pin by hand because visibility cannot accessible without multiple mirrors. Then we performed ops check by actuating tail rotor pedals moving the tube back and forth operation seemed normal. I was not present for when the aircraft was doing ground runs when the aircraft shifted on the ground. I was later notified by my maintenance manager [in the evening] that there was an incident and I would need to write a statement what was my part of the maintenance performed. To avoid this ever happening again a bore scope should be used to see into the compartment that way you can see the side view and be able to tell that it was just not jammed in the bell-crank. Even performing the static check on the ground wasn't enough because the operation felt normal and actuated the tail rotor. After reviewing the maintenance procedures again a step was missed by performing a rigging check there is special tools needed for this step and I was not aware of this step because of the training we had in the hanger it was always taught to match thread count that was so the rigging would not be thrown off. The maintenance procedures need to be followed step by step and reviewed again to make sure a step was not missed.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

A T38 was on an ILS approach to AFW. My plan was to put the FA20 on the downwind and let AFW Tower provide visual and sequence the FA20 behind the T38. I turned the FA20 toward AFW and he immediately reported the airport in sight and I cleared him for the visual approach. I then tried to contact AFW Tower; but the shout line was not working and they would not answer. The only way to contact them was the telephone and I did not have time for that. I then issued a new heading away from the ILS final and altitude to the FA20 and told him it was a vector to follow traffic.

83,83,83,83,3398,While operating on an IFR flight plan; I noticed that my route would take me across the top of the ZZZ Airport. I am familiar with the Skydiving operation there; so as I was approaching approximately 15 miles from the northwest; I tuned in the ZZZ CTAF frequency on my #2 COM radio to listen in for the jump aircraft. I never heard the aircraft take off and never observed anything on my traffic display as I was approaching. At about 10 miles northwest of ZZZ; [Center] cleared me; at pilot's discretion; to start my initial descent from 9;000 ft MSL down to 4;000 ft MSL. A build up of clouds was occurring in the immediate vicinity; and at about 7;000 ft MSL; I started going in and out of the tops of the clouds. Shortly thereafter I noticed an aircraft appear on my ADS-B traffic display at 2;500 ft below me and climbing. I surmised that it was the jump aircraft; but still had not heard anything on the CTAF frequency or the ARTCC frequency. At approximately 5 miles northwest of ZZZ; I heard the pilot of the jump aircraft check on to the ARTCC frequency. The pilot was alerted by the controller that I was descending behind and above the jump aircraft. The pilot called 'No joy' on me. I was also advised of the aircraft; and responded that I was inside of a cloud with no visual contact. At some point; according to my traffic display; the jump aircraft made a left turn back into my flight path while I was still inside of the cloud; and I received a traffic alert on my GTN650. Upon exiting the cloud; I made an immediate right bank; followed by a left bank to try and acquire the jump aircraft. When I identified the aircraft; it was still climbing on a heading that could have potentially taken it into my original flight path. I would estimate we were within 500 ft of each other; maybe more like 300 ft. I was close enough that I could see the skydiver's faces that were standing in the jump door. After ensuring I was clear of the aircraft; I notified [Center] that I was clear of the aircraft and that it posed no further issue. The controller responded. The pilot of the jump aircraft also responded that I had been identified visually. The remaining 10 minutes of the flight were uneventful; however; I was left very shaken up. After landing and reflecting on the event; I wondered what I could've done differently. Overall; I could've requested a route around ZZZ.

84,84,84,84,6910,I took over the sector from another controller. He had received coordination from ZMP that Aircraft X had requested FL065 due to unfavorable winds higher. When I took over the aircraft was non-radar and I thought the aircraft was VFR not IFR due to misinterpreting the data block. When Aircraft X came back on radar it was level at 065 entering a 070 MIA box. I was confused why it was flashing MSAW [Minimum Safe Altitude Warning] as a VFR and asked the pilot. The pilot said they were IFR so I climbed them immediately to 070 for terrain. I believe this was because it was easy to misinterpret a non-radar IFR at a VFR altitude as a VFR. When I gave a briefing to the next controller I told him the airplane behind Aircraft X; who was in a similar situation: level at 075 IFR non-radar; was IFR. Minutes after the briefing I came back and told him again just to be clear and he said 'Oh I thought he was VFR.' I should review Low Altitude Alert phraseology; it was not issued.

90,90,90,90,1131,LGA's configuration was landing and departing runway 22. It was a hot day so most of the departures were taking a little longer to depart than usual. Aircraft Y was holding in position with Aircraft X on final. Aircraft X was issued traffic and told to reduce to final approach speed. I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff with Aircraft X on about 1 3/4 mile final. I advised Aircraft Y no delay on departure for the arriving traffic. Aircraft Y was 6000 feet down the runway when Aircraft X was coming up to the runway threshold but was not off the ground yet. I issued a go around to Aircraft X. The cab coordinator advised me to keep Aircraft X on runway heading but I decided to turn the aircraft 15 degrees right to get a little more separation and climbed the aircraft to 2000 feet. I was providing visual separation between the two aircraft as the departure was going to be making a left turn (070 heading). Once I observed Aircraft Y in the turn I turned Aircraft X back to a 220 heading. I kept both aircraft on my frequency the entire time. As the go around instructions were being coordinated there was a lot of noise on the control room floor. After the aircraft was separated all I heard from the cab coordinator was to switch the go around to the approach control frequency. I did not hear any control instructions to climb the aircraft higher than the initial 2000 feet. No control instructions were written on the arrival strip by the cab coordinator who had coordinated the go around. There is an issue with the MVA regarding go around/missed approaches off of runway 22. The MVA is 2700 feet but LGA only owns up to 2000 feet. If; for any reason; you need to turn an aircraft; higher has to be coordinated immediately. Coordinating with N90 isn't always quick and separating the aircraft is my first responsibility/priority. The MVA 2700 feet is for the Freedom Tower (WTC) and I can visually see the building from the tower cab. Turning a go-around/missed approach to a 235-240 degree heading will not put it in any proximity to that building. The other recommendation is that the cab coordinator writes down the go around instructions on the strip or at least make sure the local controller acknowledges those instructions. There are times that things could be missed or not heard correctly and having them written down is a good way that they wouldn't be missed or misinterpreted.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

95,95,95,95,7163,Shortly after the aircraft left it had to shut down #1 engine in-flight due to being uncontrollable.

I had worked on the #1 engine at various times three days earlier from late afternoon [Day X] until the early morning hours the following day [Day Y]. Earlier in the day; on Day X; a post-check run had determined that the idle RPM of #1 engine was too high. There were several adjustments made to the Idle RPM throughout the night and several engine runs to determine if the problem had been corrected. I believe that factors contributing to the shutdown of #1 engine during flight can be attributed to many things. These factors include but are not limited to: Fatigue: it was my fifth night after already working over 40-hours the first four days of my week.Weather: the temperature was around -10F throughout the night; this also has an effect on the fatigue factor. Lighting: we have to work with headlamps at night; it is not the ideal lighting situation. Time crunch: the plane was fresh out of a heavy check and we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to get as much done as possible so the plane can fly and make money.

Just passed MGW; I left the number one radio to go over to number two; record the ATIS; and call the FBO to ensure passenger transportation was set up. While I was off the center frequency; the Captain queried ATC if we were to expect a 'descend via' clearance. The 'descend via' clearance was given just past the BRNDN Intersection. The Captain initiated a descent to comply with the crossing altitudes and speed restrictions. When I returned to the number one radio the Captain and I had a brief discussion about the changes that had occurred while I was off frequency. It soon became apparent that we would not be able to comply with the 280 KTS at JIMVE Intersection due to the late 'descend via' clearance. We advised ATC of this.This is a relatively new arrival with lots of crossing restriction and is very busy. The first few fixes are very close together.

98,98,98,98,9919,I was scheduled to fly one leg with a Captain upgrade candidate to complete an FAA observation for him that had been canceled earlier. Due to extraneous circumstances the original FAA observer was unable to do the checkride. The three of us arrived at the departure gate and awaited the arrival of the inbound aircraft. It was running about 20 minutes late. Once the passengers started to deplane; I went down the jetway to start my preflight duties. During the interior preflight we noticed that the oxygen level was below 1;410 PSI and the OXY LOW PRESS caution was posted. I had the First Officer call in the discrepancy and enter it in to the maintenance logbook. The line mechanics showed up to the airplane and serviced the oxygen to 'normal' levels and signed the logbook. The First Officer had mentioned to me that it had been written-up previously. I looked at the logbook and saw the write-up. After the maintenance action was completed; we boarded up and departed. While in cruise; we noticed the oxygen level was depleting. The Check Airman was in the jumpseat and asked to look at the logbook. He started to scrutinize all entries that related to oxygen. He discovered nine write-ups relating to oxygen servicing since Christmas. Upon completion of the flight; we observed the oxygen pressure had lost 220 LBS since servicing one hour before. The oxygen level was still above the caution level; but was getting close. We notified the outbound crew of our findings and observations; and they subsequently called maintenance. This is a tricky situation for us. We; as line pilots; don't determine airworthiness; but maintenance did us no favors by routinely servicing the oxygen. The oxygen had been serviced only hours before. There has to be some accountability on their end of this for a poor remedy to an obviously reoccurring problem. We probably should not have taken this airplane. I needed to do a more thorough review of the logbook. If I would have scrutinized each individual write-up better; I possibly would have noticed that it had not only been serviced that day; but exactly how many times it had been serviced in the recent past. Crew communication may have prevented this also. I should have approached the Captain that brought it in and asked some questions. All these oxygen systems vary a little. I assumed that the pressure drop was from the recent cold snap; since every aircraft I have been in the last two days had depleted oxygen levels. Complacency was a factor here. I need to remain vigilant all day every day.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
99,99,99,99,8819,Descending on the EAGUL5 into PHX; Center cleared us direct HOMRR with no speed restriction until reaching HOMRR. The STAR requires crossing HOMRR at or below 16;000 FT at 250 KTS. The FMS was programmed with the arrival; and VNAV was selected as well. All seemed well as we descended to and crossed HOMRR at 16;000 FT/250 KTS. However the next fix VNNOM required crossing between 11;000 FT and 10;000 FT VNNOM is 4.1 NM from HOMRR. Crossing HOMRR at 16;000 FT; we realized that it was almost impossible to lose 5;000 FT to 6;000 FT in 4.1 NM. At this point I clicked off the automation and pointed the nose down; achieving a descent rate of better than 6;000 FPM. Our airspeed increased to 280 KTS and we crossed VNNOM high and fast. I do not believe that we caused a conflict with any other aircraft.I have flown many; many VNAV STARs in this aircraft; and it has never been off before. The STAR called for crossing HOMRR at or below 16;000 FT; and the FMS should have been in a position to make the next subsequent fix.Obviously we could have done a better job monitoring the situation; however this occurred during an extremely high workload period. We made; programmed and verified 2 runway/ approach changes during this descent prior to HOMRR. In fact the first change went from a landing east flow to a landing west flow. This could actually explain why the FMS logic chose 16;000 FT at HOMRR instead of lower....Landing east on the EAGUL5 requires crossing a different fix immediately past HOMRR (SMAAK) between 15;000 FT and 14;000 FT.This is a really poorly designed STAR.

Shortly after reaching cruise altitude of FL280; we noticed a low oil qty (0%) and dropping oil pressure (approximately psi). I called for QRH and Captain began running Low Oil Pressure Checklist.  While accomplishing the checklist; the oil pressure dropped below 15 psi and entered the Warning (Red) regime.  This drove us to shutdown the #1 engine.

104,104,104,104,10801,While assembling a GE C2 transfer gearbox; I noticed a possible discrepancy in the way the shroud was installed on adapter of horizontal gearshaft. The manual has a note that reads: With adapter aligned as it fits on the transfer gearbox; the housing shroud must be installed at the 6 o'clock position. My concern is I may have installed the shroud incorrectly on possible 5 gear boxes in the past several months while performing maintenance under check and repair guidelines. If they were installed incorrectly it would not be evident because a gear backlash check is not required which would alert the mechanic to the problem. We do perform a pressure test. The pressure test would not alert mechanic to shroud being installed incorrectly. It is possible to install it in the 12 o'clock position and not know it on a check and repair the gearbox.

105,105,105,105,302,In cruise flight at altitude I experienced a slowly increasing surging/roughness of engine; I promptly went full rich on mixture; checked gauges and everything looked fine; except for the fact that the engine was now fluctuating about 200-300 RPM. I declared an urgency situation and asked for vectors to the nearest field which where given at 11 miles on my current heading. I opted for a small airport approximately 5 miles to my 6 o'clock and informed ATC. At this point the fluctuations began to worsen; now fluctuating between 500-600 rpm. It became apparent that I would have difficulty maintaining altitude with the current engine situation. I did not have the airport in sight yet and I was unsure how much longer I would have power as the engine situation continued to degrade. With what little I knew of the situation and unsure of the engine's integrity I declared an emergency. Still continuing to descend I switched tanks from both to left and then right; shortly after switching to the right tank the roughness cleared up and I continued my descent to landing. After consultation with mechanic the final consensus was water in the fuel that ran out shortly after switching tanks. At the time I still had over 12 gallons each tank and had sumped both the carb and fuel tanks on preflight. I continued on to my destination airport and back to my departure uneventfully. One thing that I was able to take away from this was my unpreparedness for the emergency. Once I realized what was going on adrenaline hit and my mind seemed to cloud over. I don't even remember applying carb heat at all and much of what I did really made no sense thinking back on it. My flying went down the tubes as soon as the emergency presented itself. My approach to my alternate field was horrible; I nearly overshot the runway. My action steps for addressing the issue where scattered and fragmented at best. I allowed fear to completely control me and without what little training I applied it could have ended in a disaster. The only thing I could have done better was train myself better for emergencies such as this. There is no getting around it whatsoever; the only way to survive emergencies in the air is to be prepared for the worst and train for them.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

108,108,108,108,7227,At approximately the beginning of the last hour of my flight to TTD; Salt Lake Center cleared us direct to our destination. I thanked the Controller but told them we were already cleared and going direct to our destination which I verified by looking at the MFD; our flight plan; the magenta needle; and the AFCS. The Controller said it looked like we were drifting off course but no further mention was made. About 15 minutes later; the Controller issued us a heading about 15 degrees to the left of our present heading to fly to our destination. This really confused me although I have had experiences with ATC's radar being wrong or vectors being wrong due to the fact they didn't account for the wind. I told the Controller what we were showing wind out of the north at 45 knots which explained in my mind why they say saw us flying north of our destination and issued a vector left. Being perplexed by all this; I zoomed out on the MFD to insure we were flying to our destination which I still showed. I even re-entered TTD into the flight plan with the same results. I was handed off to the next Controller and told them we were on a vector but that I now showed us drifting off our direct course to our destination. But this Controller confirmed what the other controllers had said. At this point; I knew something was wrong and the controllers really could be right. I closely examined our course. When I had zoomed out previously; the level of detail (other airports; state lines; etc) was very minimal. I began scrolling through the flight plan lines with the cursor which displays the flight plan waypoints in detail on the map. In doing so; I saw that our destination airport waypoint of TTD was actually near R-5701 airspace close to the PDT and HRI area. Having flown in that area for years I realized that the controllers were correct the whole time and I was astounded by this error. I tried typing in TTD several more times via different G1000 and Prodigy software methods with the same incorrect waypoint results. I typed in PDX which is only about 6 miles west of TTD and sure enough; the vector we were provided was correct. I called the Controller and told them we figured out the error could resume our own navigation and thanked them. They then told me they would have a reroute for me (likely due to the actual path being north of what was flown and planned and the mountains). I was given direct HHOOD; BONVL; then TTD. There were no further abnormalities from there. For sake of experiment after landing and shutdown; I powered the aircraft's electrical system back up and entered TTD waypoint and the database brought up with the correct fix. As best as I could tell; the flight plan waypoint TTD was entered as a user waypoint (orange in color on the Garmin/Prodigy MFD) during the flight somehow.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Aircraft was level flight; VNAV / LNAV engaged with autopilot on; utilizing good CRM. At approximately 35 miles from PRISE; Pilot Monitoring noticed we should have begun our descent (3 miles per 1;000 feet at normal descent speeds); but verified the path at our increased speed (310 KIAS) that we still had a few miles of level flight remaining. Pilot Monitoring made PA to cabin and upon return ATC asked whether we would make our crossing restriction at PRISE. At that point; both Pilot Flying and Pilot Monitoring realized we were no longer in VNAV and Pilot Flying selected LVL CHG and we began a high speed descent in accord with ATC instructions to maintain 310 or greater. Pilot Flying increased airspeed to 320 and extended speed brakes to make the crossing at 12;000 [feet].When within 5 kts of barber pole; both pilots expected the autopilot to slowly pitch up when there was a sudden increase in airspeed due to unexpected turbulence and the high speed alert sounded and we exceed Vmo by 15-20 kias.

He responded that he had a left alternator issue. I asked if he needed any assistance; and he said 'no'.I then tried to communicate with the pilot about NOTAMs and have him report receipt of weather; but got no response. I later observed the aircraft descend below the MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude); down to 9500 feet. Since he had reported an alternator issue; I could only imagine that he'd lost radio contact and had the field in sight and was commencing approach. He later got back on radio and said he had been off the radio listening to weather. I restated one zero thousand as assigned altitude and he climbed back up.

The item had been written up at the gate before departure and was deferred by Maintenance with the following entry: 'Checked and appd for deferral. Placarded #1 autopilot inop per MEL.' Aircraft flew 6 times after that write up. The First Officer and I reviewed the Mel 22-01A (as cited in the logbook) and complied with it fully. Shortly after takeoff I realized that both NDs needed to be in the same range to avoid the 'map not available' display on the captain's ND. Further investigation revealed that FMGC 1 position indicated all dashes. We now suspected that the logbook incorrectly addressed an autopilot 1 failure; not a failure of FMGC 1. Thinking that Maintenance misdiagnosed the original problem we called Maintenance Control and discussed the situation. Together we decided to perform an FMGC manual reset.

116,116,116,116,5462,The report is for an incident that occurred on company B767-300 aircraft. The aircraft received major damage to the front lower section of fuselage when the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) collapsed. The incident was initiated by a chronic leak of the Left Hydraulic System.   I; Mechanic X; along with two other Mechanics; Y and Z; were trying to find the source of the hydraulic leak. According to the chronic paperwork attached to the Maintenance package of the aircraft that night; we had to service the Left Hydraulic System and perform visual checks of the rudders and tail section Aft Rigging Bay Compartment.  Mechanic Y noticed hydraulic fluid leaking from the aft drain mast; so we proceeded to investigate the aft rigging bay. We then noticed hydraulic fluid all along the lower section of the aft tail rigging compartment; forward of the Tail Skid Actuator. We found the flexible hoses connected to the actuator saturated in hydraulic fluid; and also one the B-nut's on the Return line was loosen by half a turn.  So we (Mechanic Y and I) proceeded to tighten the line and clean the [Tail Skid] actuator for leak checks.  Now none of the mechanics; including myself; was familiar with the Tail Skid System on a B767s.  So we all headed back to the Line Maintenance shack to research the Tail Skid System. We read through Chapter 32 and found the Tail Skid System in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 32-71-00). I found the Description and Operation (D/O) Manual and we (Mechanic Y and I) proceeded to read through the Manual for a better understanding of the system.  After reading the manual; we (Mechanic Y and I) found a section (page 8 of 10) that talks about the retraction of the [Tail Skid] actuator.  So we went back out to the aircraft after getting more supplies; and began to perform the retraction procedure for the actuator. I positioned myself in the Aft Tail section to observe any potential leak while Mechanic Y went to the cockpit and the other guy (Mechanic Z) positioned [himself] on the Scissor Lift Truck. I observed the actuator; looking for leaks as the strut began to retract.  While performing the check; we kept in contact using our cellphones. The actuator moved to the fully retracted position and was seated flush against the fuselage; so we began the extension procedure and the aircraft shook violently.  I was jarred from my position and fell on lower structure of the aircraft in the aft tail section.  After gathering myself; I evacuated the tail section of the aircraft and proceeded to the front of the aircraft where I noticed the nose gear had collapsed causing structural damage.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
117,117,117,117,2602,Approach Control gave us a 330 heading to intercept the localizer and cleared us for the approach. We were then turned over to Tower. As we converged with the localizer the FMA annunciated LOC CAP and my flight director indicated a turn; but the #2 autopilot did not turn the airplane to join. I stated that we needed to turn right as the airplane continued on the 330 heading. The First Officer disengaged the autopilot and made the correction to the right. His flight director; however; was giving incorrect inputs; thus making bracketing back to the localizer very difficult. In the final approach the FMA annunciated 'heading' and 'no autoland' for about a minute then went out. The First Officer did a fine job of flying the airplane down to the runway and made an uneventful landing in 400 FT OVC and 7 miles visibility weather. I did not query ATC if they were having problems with the ILS and we wrote up the #2 autopilot and flight director. In retrospect; I should have alerted the Tower Controller of our difficulties; but we were quite involved in the flying of the airplane.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
118,118,118,118,2169,We were enroute to ZZZ and at FL390. We felt and heard a brief thud; then noticed the #2 engine N1 had decreased approximately 8%. We suspected a possible compressor stall. This lasted maybe a few seconds and engine operation returned to normal. We also noticed that the #2 engine EGT had increased slightly. We decided to start a descent just in case we eventually might need to be at a single engine altitude. ATC initially cleared us to FL370 and then to FL310. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying. As power was reduced further; we felt an increase in vibration with a corresponding increase on the VIB reading.We increased power to a mid-position and vibration readings returned to normal. During this time; we also evaluated possible diversion airports; and ZZZ1 was closest with excellent weather conditions as well. We continued descent to FL250 and ran the Engine Limit/Surge Stall Checklist. We followed all pertinent procedures but since engine parameters were normal except for the slightly higher EGT; we stopped at 'Engine Runs Normally.' Just an FYI; The flight attendants and passengers were kept fully informed that we were evaluating what had occurred; and at present; we're continuing to ZZZ.At that point I wanted to send an ACARS message to Dispatch to advise what was going on; and to voice contact us on the ZZZ1 Ops frequency. I get ready to type...'ACARS NO COMM' illuminated. I typed it in anyhow and as I got ready to call ZZZ1 Ops; Dispatch came on line. They were apprised of our situation; would they 'please advise Maintenance Control; and at present we're continuing to ZZZ.' Shortly after finishing with Dispatch it became apparent that a ZZZ1 diversion would be a more prudent plan. While the VIB indicator was still around .6 for the #2 engine; the EGT was creeping up slowly and now about 80 degrees greater than engine #1.ATC was informed of our request to proceed to ZZZ1 and we were cleared direct. While we did not declare an emergency; we did ask to have the emergency equipment standing by. We opted to operate #2 at idle power for the duration of the flight. All appropriate checklists and procedures were accomplished; flight attendants were informed of our divert; that we weren't planning on anything further out of the ordinary and asked if they would please plan as they normally would for an arrival. Passengers were advised we would be diverting to ZZZ1 as a precaution. The single approach was uneventful followed by a normal landing. No brake cooling issues. After landing on Runway XXR and turning from [the first] taxiway onto [the second] taxiway; we were advised by the fire trucks that they saw a flame in the 'tailpipe' of engine #2. We shut the engine down with the start lever; pulled the appropriate fire handle but did not discharge the bottle; and accomplished the proper checklist. The trucks advised the fire was out and we taxied to the terminal. Passengers were eventually deplaned and were to be accommodated on a flight later in the evening.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
119,119,119,119,6304,Recently Denver has added a series of RNAV STARs that seem to be taxing the FMC's capability on 737NG aircraft. What is new to these approaches is that they have numerous step-down and speed restrictions. These I assume are [intended] to improve aircraft flow by better coordinating aircraft separation and reducing separation distance by eliminating some of the variables in altitude and speed that were possible in the less restrictive RNAV approaches previously used. My experience on three separate recent occasions is that 737NG aircraft are too often unable to meet the restrictions by relying on the FMC. On one approach VNAV PATH dropped into PITCH/CWS three times; on another the aircraft leveled at an arbitrary altitude that was neither on the MCP or CDU and; most recently; VNAV PATH failed to make most altitudes and made none of the speed restriction. The CDU didn't display Drag Required; nor did the FMC drop into CWS; or display any [directed] control of the aircraft['s vertical path] although I should note that ATC started us down late on that last arrival. My First Officer and I had a long conversation over these and other arrivals we have had into Denver and agree that; on these approaches; crews will need to inform ATC that we [are able to] meet altitude restrictions or speed restrictions; but not both. [Flight crews can utilize the 'classic'] three miles per thousand feet crutch to monitor autoflight performance; of course; but isn't that meant to be a backup to automation? With these new Denver approaches three per thousand is going to have to be the primary descent path methodology and; with many more step-downs and speed restrictions; won't this further task the flight crews instead of easing their workload? Do we really want pilots in level change spinning down the altitude window five or six times and reloading speeds on the descent page every few minutes on an approach that should be flown in VNAV PATH?,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
120,120,120,120,8907,The air conditioning was very poor in the last 4 rows and worse in the aft galley of the aircraft.  We initially pushed off the gate and were unable to start the left engine because the left engine fuel valve did not open. We started the right and taxied back to the gate for Maintenance. Maintenance came out and worked on the aircraft. I deplaned the aircraft due to heat concerns for the aft part of the aircraft. I queried the Flight Attendant's if they wanted to get off the flight. They responded they were staying on the flight. After several hours and working several problems including Left Bleed Duct overheat Maintenance finally put an MEL on the aircraft for the Left Pack inoperative. It is not unusual to have a warm aircraft on the ground when the heat out side is 94 degrees and experience shows that once airborne the aircraft cools down quickly. I conferred with the Flight Attendant's if they were safe to work the flight with one pack and get airborne and cool off the aircraft. I again offered to replace them if they felt uncomfortable. They said they were good to go. We pushed off the gate again and taxied out. About 5 minutes prior to takeoff the Lead Flight Attendant informed me that another Flight Attendant had told her we had a passenger with asthma in the rear of the aircraft but related no symptoms or complaints. My understanding was the passenger had no symptoms but asthma was a condition the person had; just as many have asthma. There were no conditions of an asthma attack related. Later this Flight Attendant would confirm after landing that was the case before takeoff. There must have been some misunderstanding as she later denied she said that. We took off and climbed out passing 15;000 feet we got a call from a Flight Attendant who said we had an incapacitated passenger from the heat and that it was 104 degrees in the rear of aircraft. I told her we would go back and land and then declared an Emergency with ATC and turned back to land. I sent a diversion message and First Officer called company; requested gate; jetway drivers; parkers and medics to meet us. I made an announcement to the passengers we were returning to land. We performed the Descent and Approach checklists and briefed a visual approach. I gave four bells with the No Smoking bell descending through 10;000 feet because we were close to the field. We had 4 calls from Flight Attendant's below 10;000 feet requesting an ambulance for the child who was overcome by heat; lethargic and non-responsive and other issues. Each subsequent call increased the perceived urgency of landing. There were difficulties with communicating with the Flight Attendant's on interphone and I actually gave an additional 4 bells on the Aft Flight Attendant call bell trying to contact them. We performed the Landing checklist after flaps 30. Some Flight Attendant's were working with the ill passenger in the aisle and may not have heard the signal and did not notice the landing gear go down or other signals due to concern with the child as he was unresponsive and they were very concerned for the child. On landing when engines were reversed and brakes applied; a cart in the rear galley came loose and FA #3 stopped it with her arm as best she could and was injured arm; shoulder; neck; and ankle. She saved probable injuries to passengers by doing so. The Lead Flight Attendant was also was hit by cart; needed assistance from passenger to push the cart back; but said she was not injured. We landed [and] Flight Attendant requested an additional ambulance and medics for injured Flight Attendant #3. We called Operations again; on ground for a gate and the reply was standby. They then gave us a gate; which was not equipped for a B767 but no one was there to meet us and took a delay to get to jetway; due to repositioning the aircraft. It took a long time to get the jetway hooked to the door. The child was doing better by the time we got to the gate as he had ice packs and medical personnel from on board assisting. Medics came on and child was taken off. Medics went to the rear of the aircraft to assist Flight Attendant #3 and she was assisted off on stretcher with injuries to her neck; arm; and ankle. Aircraft was written up for poor cooling in the aft section.Cause:1. Left pack was on MEL. Rear aircraft vents were putting out hot air raising the temperature to unacceptable levels. Temperatures rose in the rear of aircraft and caused illness for passenger.   2. Additional injury to Flight Attendant occurred because one of the galley carts was not secured for landing and it rolled out and Flight Attendant stopped it with her arm. There was some confusion caused by interphone communications which were difficult to understand. Subsequently; the Flight Attendant's called 4 times below 10;000 feet to request an ambulance and give other advisories. Some of these were garbled and when I answered; went unacknowledged because I could not hear a reply.3. The rear shades where the Flight Attendant's were working had been closed to help cool the aircraft with a loss of outside visual cues for the Flight Attendant's in reference to landing. Because of concentration on passenger assistance and all the call bells they were unsure of landing time.4. Because of the urgency expressed by Flight Attendant's we did not have the luxury of using a time barrier to delay the landing and were concerned with further passenger incapacitation. We were concerned next call would be about a heart attack or stroke.5. On initial communication of problem from Lead Flight Attendant; I told her we were going back to land immediately. TEST info may not have been complete enough.Suggestions:1. Aircraft need more ground time for maintenance.  2. Operations personnel need better training in responding to emergencies to provide gates and parkers in an expedited manner. They were called and were not available for 14 minutes. 3. Better training with Flight Attendant's communicating with cockpit and situation awareness.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
121,121,121,121,1906,[We] worked a repeat squawk on this aircraft for a nose wheel shimmy. We determined that the upper and lower nose gear torque links needed changed. My colleague was doing the maintenance and I was inspecting his work. On the previous write up for this squawk; another vendor had replaced all hardware for the torque links. I requested the upper and lower torque links and bushings from MCC (Maintenance Control Center) per CE750 CMM (Component Maintenance Manual) 32-20-02-XXXX. I originally requested items number 97 and number 315 for the upper and lower torque links. I later talked to MCC and they told me that they had ordered the torque links with the bushings already installed so they didn't order bushings.When we received the parts for the aircraft; I checked the paperwork for the torque links and noticed that the part numbers for the torque links didn't match the item numbers I had originally requested. I then looked in the CMM to verify that these were the proper parts. They were the complete assemblies including bushings per the CMM (items number75 and number 300). There is no verbiage in the CMM that explains what the complete torque link assemblies contain.We removed the upper torque link from the aircraft and carefully set aside all hardware from the assemblies. We did the upper torque link first and reinstalled the new torque link with the hardware removed from the old assembly. We torqued all hardware per the maintenance manual and safe tied the nuts. We then did the same for the lower torque link. Both upper and lower torque links were free of play at this point when you attempted to move them by hand.We were later informed that there were spacers (item number 83) that were not installed with the assemblies. These spacers were not installed on the assemblies prior to us removing them for replacement. A video from the vendor who found this shows that there is a lot of play in the torque links. In the video however; the condition of the torque links is not as the vendor found them. He had obviously removed the cotter keys from the nuts and loosened the torque as there are no threads visible past the nuts. We had the nuts torqued and safe tied when we changed the torque links. The excessive play shown in the video was not present after we torqued the nuts.I believe that the component manual should contain a detailed description of what parts are included in the complete torque link assemblies. It's very easy to overlook the spacers on installation because the drawings could lead you to believe they could have been part of the torque link assemblies.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

124,124,124,124,3392,On visual approach from IMC to the runway; we were unstabilized at 500 AGL and the Captain; as pilot flying; initiated a go around. As the First Officer placed the CTOT [Continuous Torque On Takeoff] switch to APR [Automatic Power Reserve]; the right engine feathered and the crew noted the Master Warning and Master Caution Annunciations and identified and verified that the right engine had auto-coarsened by observing the Right Prop Oil Pressure at zero. The Right Engine Torque was at zero and the Right Engine Prop RPM all confirmed the Prop Oil Pressure Indication.The Captain then called for; and the crew executed; the QRH for Engine Failure which called for the crew to shut down and secure the engine. We notified ATC that we had lost the right engine and we would be extending our upwind and downwind and returning for landing on the runway. During the First Officer's (Captain briefed) PA announcement the Captain declared an emergency with ATC and clarified our intention to land. ATC issued landing clearance and asked if assistance was needed.A normal twenty flaps landing was uneventful and the aircraft was slowed and taxied clear of the runway.

Cleaned up the flaps on schedule kept speed at VFS and advised Departure of our possible return to the field. I ran the QRH and the First Officer kept flying. I cycled the landing gear per the QRH and got the same EICAS indication. We accessed that the gear never retracted when selecting the lever to the up position. There were no changes in the flight characteristics that we could tell. I advised ATC; Dispatch; Operations; Flight Attendants and the passengers of the situation and that we were returning to land. Landing gear was down and locked with no abnormal EICAS indications. Landed normally and returned to the gate. Maintenance cancelled the flight and passengers were put on the next flight. It seemed that the signal to raise the gear did not work. The gear handle is in disagreement with the position of the gear and the EICAS message Landing Gear Disagree annunciates.

130,130,130,130,2323,Midway through the flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 we received 'HYDR #1 PUMP 3' CAS (Crew Alert System) message. The QRH states that system operating times will take longer than expected and that no other action was required. We continued the flight after notifying home base of the situation. Quantity showed 100% on the synoptic page with a pressure stabilized at 3;000 psi.On the arrival to ZZZ1 we were given a level off altitude and 'HYDR #1 PUMP 1' CAS message appeared. Soon after pressure fluctuated between 0 and 3;000 psi. causing CAS messages to appear then extinguish when pressure was high. Due to sequencing into ZZZ1 we had extended vectors for the ILS XX circle to land runway YY. During this time The PIC and I decided we would configure early so I could get a feel of the aircraft and allow extra time for gear extension; flap extension; ect. After being established on a long final for runway XX circle YY; I asked for gear down. We received 3 red down arrows but heard what I would consider normal gear down. We then overflew the airfield so tower could view if the gear was down then executed the missed approach for the ILS XX.The tower reported the gear was down but our indication was three red arrows. After being handed off to ZZZ2 we received delay vectors to trouble shoot the gear issue. At this time hydraulic quantity on system 1 was zero. Because we had a red gear indication; PNF followed the checklist that included pulling the gear T-handle. We still had three red gear indications so we followed the checklist for the gravity free fall. Because the checklist required 190 knots for gravity gear drop I commanded the aircraft to clean wing. This set off additional 'inboard slat fail' CAS message and we added the landing distance penalty required by the checklist.The PNF then followed the checklist for the gravity gear deploy checklist. He pulled the left main gear pull-handle and I applied full left rudder per the checklist; resulting with a left main gear down green indication. As I returned the aircraft to rudder neutral the nose gear indicated down and locked. The PNF then pulled the right main gear pull handle and after applying a slight right rudder the right main gear appeared down and locked. The PNF finished the checklist and we had a three green gear indication.We determined because of the hydraulic/gear issues it was in our best interest to declare an emergency and return to ZZZ and have crews standing by in the event the gear would collapse. Airport conditions were VFR and favored runway XX. We landed the airplane as a non-event and were towed to the FBO due to the loss of nose wheel steering.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

134,134,134,134,8306,I was reviewing the shipset's Flight Manual in preparation for my upcoming Proficiency Check. I noticed that the entire Maneuvers section was missing.

136,136,136,136,4634,I was given a direct approach and cleared to land by the Tower while still 7 miles to the east; likely not visible to the Tower. No further communication from the Tower was received until I inadvertently landed with the gear retracted. No gear up warning horn was sounded. Upon stopping on the runway; I immediately reported the situation to the Tower. He immediately replied that the emergency equipment was on the way. The FBO responded with a crew to jack up and remove the aircraft from the runway. But before doing so; the Maintenance Director tested the landing gear and found that the warning horn was inoperative. Obviously it's the pilot's responsibility to insure gear extension. However; the situation could have been prevented if one or more contributing factors were not in play: 1) gear extension is usually performed just before entering the downwind pattern. As a matter of habit; the approach to downwind triggers the gear down response. A near straight in approach was given instead. 2) Aircraft given to land while not yet in sight. Apparently no further observation of the aircraft was made until too late. This was at a low traffic time with few planes on frequency. Tower could have instructed to continue towards the airport and cleared after confirming gear down when in sight. 3) Controllers at a nearby Airport usually use the expression 'check wheels down; cleared to land' as the landing clearance. This requires only 1.5 additional seconds yet keeps flying safe and the runway clear. Additionally; it relieves the Tower from visually checking (as in 2 above). 4) When the mechanic checked the gear; he pointed out that pressing the gear down light should cause the warning horn to sound. That's a good feature; but its use and meaning are not explained in Cessna's Pilot's Operating Handbook. It is not listed on any procedure checklist in the POH. 5) The cowl has yet to be opened to inspect the cause of the warning horn failure.

138,138,138,138,7941,On preflight; with the batteries on; once the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) were turned to align; the blue 'align on ref' was not displayed; nor were there alignment coordinates at 2 L and R. As a result I imputed the coordinates from the flight plan and then hit the prompts 'align on ref' and 'confirm' (not normal but not uncommon either). As I started to leave the cockpit; a 'ding' occurred. Instinctively looking back I saw the blue prompt again (which was odd; first time I had seen that). Again I pushed the blue 'align on ref' prompt followed by the amber 'confirm'; (without reconfirming the coordinates as I had just typed them in. I definitely should have rechecked in case an error was made. A potentially serious mistake; one I will never repeat). During push back I noticed a GPS INOP advisory on the Navigational Display (ND); that disappeared after engine start. Prior to taking the runway; all looked normal and displays were normal during takeoff roll. The NAV system came up NAV on the ND shortly after takeoff (like normal). Problem was the heading the NAV display was showing to fly; was 30+ degrees right of our known heading 053. We pulled for heading and continued our climb out away from the ground. Unable to deduce the error; we tried direct to waypoint ZZZZZ; then the secondary flight plan. No help.  Next I tried Attitude Hold (ATT) mode on IRUs (going from NAV to OFF to ATT) trying to fix the issue with the IRS and/or GPS; hopefully allowing for an in flight alignment. At one point I noticed the data on the FMC showing us a start point of ZZZZZ Waypoint? This effort (going to ATT) caused the entire system to shut down.  We discussed a return to ZZZ but were uncomfortable due to severe heading divergence from known (IRS/GPS issue) and the high altitude airport; heavy/overweight landing in a mountainous terrain environment. Although a declaration did not occur; ATC was fully aware of our situation giving us exceptional handling to the north; away from mountainous terrain; traffic and towards VMC weather. We discussed northern divert options. Unfortunately; we were unable to get weather via ACARS for these options. Knowing we could not enter RVSM airspace; we requested FL270 and leveled there while continuing northeast. Shortly thereafter; while trying to trouble shoot the IRU/GPS issue; we lost the cabin pressurization. This required a descent. We could not descend to 10;000ft due to terrain so we descended to 15;000ft. Able to catch the cabin altitude manually; we stayed at 15;000.We continued flying in a northerly direction utilizing the wet compass ONLY; no ND assistance. The ATT mode did provide us PFD airspeed and altitude. ATC was able to give us ZZZZ2 weather (300-1) which we decide was not our best choice (ATC was unable to give us US airport weather).  When we overflew ZZZZ3; and it was VFR; we deemed it suitable and we landed. Following were among the numerous checklists run:NAV/GPS primary lossNAV/IR 1-2; 2-3 and 1-3 faultsNAV/IR align in ATT modeplus manually running the pressurization schedule following the QRH checklist. APU on; flaps 3 uneventful landing completed. Post landing; during rollout; the brakes felt normal about 100kts; slowing at the end of the runway (to turn around and back-taxi); the brakes went to the floor (20mph?). I went full reverse while the First Officer (FO) jumped on binders with me. Feeling we weren't slowing enough; as I was reaching for the A/SKID NWS disct switch; the FO grabbed the parking brake bringing us to a quick stop (speed about 5mph). We were both thinking yellow system brakes just different ways to get there. The brakes returned. As we taxied very slowly to parking stand (brakes felt normal but getting intermittent ECAM brks caution); we queried about 'tow equipment if necessary'. We opted to continue taxi to gate. Uneventful. After passengers debriefed and [maintenance] contacted (via station operations cell phone; minedoes not work here) a thorough debriefing ending with Maintenance Control stating they would enter into [Maintenance computer] our issues. Maintenance Control then transferred us to the duty manager and we debriefed again. I asked to pass onto our dispatcher our scenario/issues and why I could not contact him (ACARS INOP).

140,140,140,140,9201,I was working approach/departure when the event occurred. Aircraft X was transitioning through ZZZ airspace enroute to ZZZ1. When they were about 13 miles southwest of ZZZ; I noticed their altitude drop a few hundred feet. I was about to verify with the pilot that they were on course; level at 5;000 feet; and give them the current altimeter; when the pilot called up. He said he needed to land immediately. I got him direct and then asked him what the nature of the [event] was. He said his door flew off and he lost a finger during the incident. I asked him how many people on board and fuel remaining. He said just himself on board and a little over 3 hours of fuel. He couldn't keep his altitude high enough for the ILS approach; so I kept him direct the field until he got it in sight. We got the emergency vehicles in their standby positions along with medical services. I coordinated with Local Control that he was cleared to land. I then relayed to him that Tower advises he was cleared to land RWY XX ZZZ.

141,141,141,141,10042,We planned 26K Bleeds Off Takeoff due to Right Pack Inop and per MEL we applied Engine Bleed Off Takeoff or Landing with the APU Operating procedure.  Cleared for takeoff on XXR. At 40% N1 CA TOGA. Both Engines advanced. Engine #2 achieved takeoff thrust of 100.8 N1. Engine #1 stagnated at 85.0 N1. Auto-throttles were on. I pushed on the #1 throttle lever to get a response; but engine stayed stagnated. I was not sure if it was an engine failure or bird strike; so I commanded PF to Reject. We Rejected below 80 knots. Announced Reject with Tower and they directed us to exit first available taxiway. We decided since we were not sure of the nature of the problem; it would be prudent to taxi back to gate and let maintenance troubleshoot the problem.A cascading effect of maintenance issues:  During pre-flight the ground crew pulled the external power without our concurrence which caused a power interruption. Had to rebuild/recover several pre-flight items. Five minutes prior to pushback right PACK light illuminated. Could not reset. Maintenance MELed right pack. During pushback/engine start we could not get N2 rotation on #2 engine with Engine Start switch in GND and Start Valve Open light illuminated. Isolation Valve switch was in the Open position. We made several attempts; but each time we moved the Engine Start switch to GND the Isolation Valve would close; and we would lose right duct pressure. We decided to return to the gate via tug and made a logbook write-up. Maintenance fixed the problem and we pushed off the gate for a second time. The low speed reject was the subsequent event.First; more vigilance/coordination from ground crew prior to pulling external power. Second; local ZZZ maintenance mentioned the plane had been sitting idle for more than 60 days. I cannot verify this information.

142,142,142,142,8643,Flight was the first leg of a three day pairing. It was my first trip back at work after being off for two months. I briefed the First Officer to this fact; and told him to watch me. We would take our time. He told me he was just off OE and not flown much after that. the weather was VFR in ZZZ but we briefed just like we would for an instrument approach; Arrival; Approach Plate; terrain issues and single engine go arounds. I also briefed that Runway XXR was closed so we planned on a visual approach backed up by the RNAV (GPS) XXL. Approach cleared us for the visual approach when we were abeam the airport and I called for flaps 1 on speed. As we slowed to Vfe Next; and the trend arrow showed we were slowing I called for flaps 2. The First Officer called 'Check Speed'; because we were still a little above Vfe Next. I referenced my airspeed and saw we were slowing and thought I would be on speed by the time I called Flaps 2 and he selected flaps 2. I called for flaps 2 and he selected flaps 2; I saw the red overspeed tape start to drop down and immediately called for flaps 1 which the First Officer did. I thought we had caught it but we got the flap overspeed warning for about 1 to two seconds; the airspeed was between 200 to 205 kts. I then slowed the aircraft and configured for landing on speed. After landing we taxied to the gate; and after shutdown I debriefed what had happened. I called Dispatch/Maintenance and made an entry into the AML.

He told me that this was normal and they do it sometimes on purpose (I do not know the details of this; other than he said they don't get along with each other). A few seconds later we began pushing back again. We again stopped abruptly. I then asked what was going on again. He told me they were going to pull us back towards the gate and push us out tail east in the alley to get us off the gate and avoid any obstacles behind the aircraft. There was a wing walker at all times during these events. I was contacted by (company) safety department about damage found to the tailcone of the aircraft by maintenance personnel the next morning.

145,145,145,145,4770,All preflight; cockpit flows; and checklists were accomplished normally at the gate. On taxi out; I tested the Take-Off Warning and it indicated a configuration issue.

I elected to continue since I felt that the transient issue had been corrected. On takeoff roll; we made the '100 kts' call indicating our entry into the high speed regime. At approximately 130-135 knots; the Take-off Warning Horn began to sound continuously. This was approximately 20 knots prior to V1. I (Pilot Monitoring) made the decision to continue and communicated that to the First Officer (Flying Pilot) by stating; 'Continue.' The Warning Horn silenced at main gear liftoff and initial climb out and the remainder of the flight was normal.

So we continued; just before takeoff we checked our computer one more time for no messages; after rotation and departure the computer still had no messages until we reached 4;000 ft. MSL. After we reached 4;000 ft. MSL the computer gave us a message of 'CABIN DOOR'. As soon as we received indication we immediately initiated checklist.

147,147,147,147,9547,After fueling the plane completely; we did the pre-flight inspection and strained the fuel for contaminants. None were found. A thorough pre-flight was done and engine run up was completed as normal; including carburetor heat check and magneto check. On the initial climb out; at approximately 1.0 mile from the end of the runway; the engine lost power. Within 3 seconds it went from full throttle to no power. Upon realizing the runway was not an option for landing; a landing was made on a four lane highway. There was no damage to the plane or any property. A Mechanic came and inspected the aircraft. The aircraft ran fine in all flight attitudes on the ground. The Mechanic suspected a couple of things. There may have been water in the aft part of the fuel tank which is not able to be strained in the 3 point position. Upon leveling off at 450 AGL to look for traffic; the water may have gone into the engine at that point; possibly freezing. Upon engine failure; carb heat was applied but the engine was wind milling at that point. After straining the fuel on the ground and checking the aircraft engine and fuel system; the State Police blocked off the highway for 2 miles and the aircraft was test run on the ground for 20 minutes before taking off and flying back to the airport. Some possible ways to prevent this from happening again would be to top off the fuel tank after every flight; and have somebody lift the tail during preflight to strain the fuel from that position.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

149,149,149,149,8324,With only main tank fuel available due to inoperative center fuel boost pumps; flight was dispatched with a conditional release to our more distant final destination.  Enroute; the Captain determined that sufficient fuel was available to continue to our final destination and upon arrival in the terminal area; we notified approach of our minimum fuel status.  A shortened pattern was provided to Runway XXL; and in spite of close encounters with 10 birds and a TCAS Traffic advisory in the final 2 miles; the Captain flew a nice stabilized approach to the runway.  Another aircraft had landed ahead of us; and apparently rolled out long; in spite of being directed to expedite clearing the runway.  We saw his lights moving to the right; indicating he was clearing the runway as we started the landing flare.  At this point; the Controller directed us to go-around; and I was immediately directed by the Captain to inform the Controller we were unable to go-around due to our fuel status; which I did.  The response from the Controller was 'Roger'. We had approximately 4;700 lb. FOB at this point; and as we touched down; we heard the other aircraft say; 'We're clear.'  The landing and rollout were uneventful and we cleared the runway at Taxiway X.  As we taxied to Spot XX; we heard the Ground Controller providing a phone number to the other aircraft to call.  Our estimation of where the other aircraft cleared the runway is either taxiway Y or Z.  We shutdown at the gate with approximately 3;700 lb. FOB.  In our estimation; had we gone around; we would have quickly progressed from a minimum fuel situation to an emergency situation.With the discussion of the minimum fuel situation aside; timely clearance of the landing runway when preceding a minimum fuel or emergency aircraft; especially when directed to do so by ATC; would have totally precluded this incident.,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Cabin lights were switching between on; off; bright; some on; half off; half bright; half off. Flight Attendant B made her way to the front of the cabin to alert me to the lack of power and we both noted the inability to control the phone as well as the lighting from the front of the cabin. After I too realized that I had no communication with the flight deck as well as the cabin crew in the back of the airplane; I slipped a note under the flight deck door 'NO COMMUNICATION WITH YOU - NO POWER IN BACK OF CABIN' I then knocked on the door to let them know I had slipped a note under the door. By this time the throttle was being pushed forward and we began to take off. The captain then aborted the take off and attempted communication with the cabin; to no avail. Captain and First Officer made contact with me to come to the flight deck to discuss what had happened. The captain's account of the events were that upon take off he received an alert in the flight deck that there was possible smoke in the aft lavatory - captain aborted take off and attempted to announce 'cabin crew to stations' over the PA. The cabin crew heard nothing. I did explain to the captain that there was not any smoke or fire in the cabin that could have been located nor did any alarm go off inside the cabin or lavatories. The First Officer called to have us return to the gate to have maintenance check the situation out and have the problem remedied or suspended. No passengers were removed from the flight during the process or after the process of fixing said issue with the electrical.

151,151,151,151,6525,Taxiing; we were sequenced behind a 737. About halfway to the runway the Captain and I noticed a large plastic bag being blown behind the 737. Evasive maneuvering was not an option as the bag was being blown toward our aircraft possibly due to excessive thrust from the 737 and the bag attached itself to Pitot tube #1 on the Captain's side. The Captain pointed it out to me; and we both realized very quickly that the bag was not going to remove itself. We coordinated with ATC to go to the ramp area to have someone in operations remove the bag. Prior to getting to the [ramp]; the Captain noticed that the bag was emitting a visible residue resembling smoke and we immediately turned off the pitot heat. While monitoring the bag to ensure there was no threat of fire; we coordinated with maintenance; operations; and ramp control to make a gate return. Maintenance was already waiting for us at the gate and fixed the Pitot tube which had melted the bag and further cleared us to depart safely. We re-dispatched and operated the flight without further issue.FOD removal and awareness should be everyone's priority. We consistently report FOD to ground and ramp control who hopefully remove it.

152,152,152,152,2571,The Captain and I were both sweating profusely and very hot after swapping aircraft for our last leg in a short period of time and in excessive heat. Our new aircraft was extremely hot in the cockpit--as many of our older 100 model airplanes are. The crew that had the airplane previously did not write the airplane up as being too hot for service; so we had no choice but to accept the airplane for our final flight of the day.During our pre-departure duties we were both very hot; but assumed the aircraft would cool after we took off. After we completed all of our checklists and paperwork; we pushed from the gate and departed. Unfortunately; the temperature in the cockpit never cooled off. The Captain and I were discussing how hot the cockpit was and were trying everything we could to cool it off. The Captain put the pressurization system into 'Cab Set' and raised the cabin altitude in an effort to bring in some cooler air. This did not do anything to cool off the cockpit. I put the pack temperature control in manual and selected cold several times; but the duct temp never dropped. It registered approximately 17C the entire time. About halfway through the flight I pulled out my union issued thermometer to check the ambient air temperature of the cockpit. The temperature registered 103F and cooled to about 97F for a short time. The temperature of the air from the recirculation duct registered 97F. Shortly thereafter; the Captain told me to take a break and relax; and that he would assume PM duties for me so that I could just relax for a minute and try to cool off because I was feeling very overheated. By this time; we were just starting our descent from our cruise altitude. In fact; the Captain had gotten permission from ATC to delay starting down as long as possible in hopes that we would be able to get some relief from the lower outside air temperature at our cruise altitude. Shortly before we started down; I began feeling light-headed and a bit nauseous. I was not unable to perform my duties; but I would say that I felt effects very similar to those associated with fatigue. The Captain told me that I was not looking very good and that I was pale. By this time I had stopped sweating even though I was still very hot. Eventually; I began to feel very dizzy; very nauseous; and even confused. By the time we were on the approach I was experiencing difficulty in performing simple tasks such as the before landing flows and checklists. I constantly felt that I was missing something; and I had to re-read the checklist several times to be sure that I did everything that I was supposed to do. I honestly felt a bit disoriented. It took me a while to realize that I didn't even have the correct airport charts out for the approach. Although the Captain had briefed the approach and I had paid attention; I did not catch that I had initially opened up my manual to the charts for another New York airport in error. I realized somewhere around our downwind leg that I had the wrong charts out. Prolonged exposure to the near 100 degree temperature in the cockpit was affecting me physically and degrading my physical and mental performance to the point that I was feeling very concerned. On the approach I noticed that my Captain did not look very healthy either. He had stopped sweating and had turned pale as well. We discussed our situation; and the Captain asked ATC if there were medical personnel available at the airfield. The Tower Controller told him that there was and the Captain requested that medical personnel meet our flight and evaluate us as we felt we were experiencing signs of heat illness. Neither the Captain nor I had ever experienced any of this before; so we wanted to make sure that we were safe to just go to the overnight hotel as long as we got into a cooler environment and got proper rest. After paramedics met with us; they suggested that we go to the hospital for further assistance; but did not insist. They told us that because we had started to sweat again and the color returned to our faces in the cool air-conditioned terminal we were showing rapid signs of improvement. They told us that if our symptoms returned; however; to call them immediately for transport to the hospital for further treatment. They explained that heat illness is cumulative and does not necessarily go away once you get into a cooler environment. After getting to the hotel; I ate dinner and drank plenty of water. I went to bed very early and slept through the night without further incident. The Captain ended up going to the hospital later that evening as he started to feel ill again. The next day as soon as it warmed up outside; I felt my symptoms return and went home sick along with my Captain. I feel like we have gotten so used to our aircraft being hot that it has become very difficult for pilots to draw the line at how hot is too hot. In this particular case; we were in a difficult position because the crew that had the airplane prior to us had not written it up as being too hot. Because we had not flown the airplane yet; we knew that the company would question us if we wrote it up before we had even flown it; going simply on our assumption that it probably WOULD BE hot. So really; our only options were to divert in-flight once we realized it was too hot; or continue to our destination as planned in the miserable conditions. I think that if I ever encounter this situation in the future I will react differently; regardless of what the company might think. My Captain and I saw first-hand how detrimental prolonged exposure to heat can be. I know that our airplanes are old; but more needs to be done to cool these planes down. I have heard that since Maintenance has been re-working some of the known hot 100 model airplanes complaints of hot cockpits are now on the rise; replacing reports of hot cabins. Our options seem to be either a hot cabin where the passengers are at risk for heat illness OR a hot cockpit where the crew is at risk for heat illness. This is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
153,153,153,153,10758,At very end of takeoff roll / unstick / initial climb-out; experienced some vibration--it was noticeable; but not what I would call heavy. It seemed to both of us that the vibration had perhaps come from the nose gear. Also got 'Antiskid Inop' light at the same time (although I did not initially see that light as it was out of my field of view while focused outside during the takeoff / initial climb). All other systems were normal. As a precautionary measure; requested Dispatch call tower to ask for a runway check to determine if we had left any rubber on the runway (28R). It took a while to get an answer; but Dispatch advised that the runway check came back as negative. Then requested Dispatch call with [maintenance] on line to discuss the issue and inquire with [maintenance] if there were any airborne trouble-shooting options for the anti-skid system (I had a failure of that same system about two months ago on initial climb-out but the light later extinguished at cruise). [Maintenance] advised there was not any procedure he could add beside the QRH which we had already run. Advised Dispatch that when we got to [destination] we would utilize runway 34L to take advantage of the length and minimize required braking. Completed abnormal performance computations; then had a minor passenger disturbance issue enroute which consumed some time. Shortly before top of descent started to get flickering of A system Eng-1 Low Pressure light. System went to zero quantity; but pressure was holding at 3;000 psi. Advised ATC we would require runway 34L. Ran the Hydraulic Pump Low Pressure QRH. We then reviewed the Loss of System A QRH so we would be familiar with it if needed. Flaps extended normally in pattern. Upon lowering gear; did not get a green light on the forward panel for the right main; but we did have a green light on the overhead panel. Was aware of the fact that this was a valid down and locked indication; however I preferred to consult the QRH given the fact that we now strongly believed we sustained tire damage on takeoff and I did not want to act on system memory and possibly miss something which may have pertained to our situation. Additionally; the A system pressure subsequently started to decrease. Elected to discontinue the approach and make left traffic so as to have time to now run the Loss of System A QRH; rather than rush the checklist on short final. Also; during the low approach (I would not call it a go-around since it was initiated at 7;000 feet) tower was able to confirm that there was in fact a damaged tire. Completed Loss of A System QRH; during the left hand traffic pattern; except did not utilize the manual gear extension procedure since it called for placing the gear handle in 'Off'. Since the gear was extended before the A system pressure went to zero; there was no yaw; and the overhead lights were green; I saw no safety benefit; and perhaps a possible detriment to taking the gear handle out of 'down' at this point. Made flaps-40 landing using only reverse for braking until at a slow taxi speed. The roll-out was bumpy but control was never in doubt. Alternate nose-gear steering functioned normally. Shut down engines (had APU running) and fire department advised that except for our bad tire and leaking hydraulics; we appeared to be in a safe condition. Air stairs were brought out and passengers de-planed into busses.

154,154,154,154,6145,This report is to document a low speed rejected takeoff. We taxied out from the gate and started both engines. During start we had an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) that said AUTO FLT YAW DAMPER 1 FAULT. We referenced checklist and contacted [Maintenance]. We shut down both engines; reset two circuit breakers and then restarted both engines to clear the fault. [Maintenance] sent us a new [Maintenance Release] and we continued taxi. The weather was VMC with light winds. Tower then cleared us for takeoff. I was the pilot flying. I taxied onto the runway and lined up for takeoff. I pushed the power up to about 1.05 EPR on both engines checked the indications and pushed the power up to flex thrust. I called out 'check thrust'. About that time the aircraft yawed to the right and the First Officer called out 'engine failure'. I rejected the takeoff. We were at about 30 to 40 knots for a low speed reject (auto brakes did not engage). I went to idle and reverse for the reject. I straightened out the aircraft with rudder to bring it back to centerline and returned the thrust levers to idle. The First Officer called the Tower about the reject and told the passengers to 'remain seated'. I slowly taxied the aircraft down the runway to analyze the malfunction. The First Officer stated he saw an ENG 2 STALL ECAM. We also saw an ENG 2 OVRSPD PROT FAULT ECAM. I decided have the First Officer run the REJECTED TAKEOFF QRC. We cleared the runway; stopped; and set the parking brake. The First Officer referenced the checklist and we shut down the number 2 engine. Tower asked if we required assistance. I said that as a precaution that I would like the fire department to look over the aircraft for any possible damage or turbine/compressor blades that may have created a FOD (Foreign Object Debris) issue. The fire department said that there was no damage to the aircraft. The brake temperatures maxed out at about 150C (normal) and there were no passenger issues in the back. I decided that we did not need to declare an emergency in this case. I contacted Dispatch and [Maintenance] to discuss our situation. We decided to return to the gate normally.

155,155,155,155,4080,The Captain and I heard a loud bang along with two Crew Alerting System (CAS) message at Vr. As the gear went up one of the CAS went away. At 1;000 FT I had the Captain turn the autopilot so we could QRH the CAS message WOW INPUT and figure out why the brake temp readout had dashed lines through the left inboard main tire. The WOW INPUT QRH told us the there is a change that the nose wheel steering would not work on landing. With that being said Captain called Maintenance to see what they wanted us to do. While he was on the other radio I got a report from a following departure that there were a lot of tire fragments all over the runway and he thought we blew a tire. Now that we knew we blew a tire we stayed with Departure Control and declared an emergency.  We had about 3;000 pounds of fuel to burn before we could make our landing weight. To burn the fuel off we turned the APU on and dumped 20 degrees of flap and dropped the landing gear to make sure that everything was working right. When we dropped the gear the second CAS message came up saying Anti Skid Inboard was not working and we assumed that both Anti Skids were not working and planned to use minimal braking action. After about 40 minutes of burning off fuel we landed; as we touched down the blown tire starting beating on the flap and underneath the wing. I used hardly any brakes and used full reversers. Once we slowed down the Captain tried the nose wheel steering and it worked and we pulled off the runway. With the tire beating on the belly of the aircraft it ripped out Hydraulic System 1 and it was leaking fluid.

There was no indication of fire from the cockpit. An aircraft behind us stated they saw a puff of smoke before the abort and also saw smoke coming from ENG 2. At this point ARFF arrived.

159,159,159,159,1060,We had prepared for approach to ATL and had just been given vectors to the ILS final off the HONIE arrival into ATL. We were flying to the airport in anticipation of an ILS to RWY 10 when ATC notified us that windshear had been reported at the airport and to expect holding. The Controller immediately gave us instructions to hold SW on the ATL 230 degree radial at 20 DME; right turns.Given that we were on vectors and no longer on the magenta line; the holding information took us a little by surprise and the PF put the information into the fix page to give us a clue where we were in relation to the holding fix while I set up the FMS to enter the holding information. The Controller queried us as to whether we were heading to the holding fix and while we had started a slow turn toward it; I wasn't completely certain where we were in relation to the fix as my head was down programming the FMS. We had not received a vector toward the fix and given that we were being vectored toward final approach just prior to getting holding instructions it took a minute to do a quick fix to fix and load the information into the FMS.

We then requested a change in the fix as the 20 DME fix was close enough to buildups that we wanted to avoid the weather. The Controller extended the holding point to the 25 DME fix; 10 mile legs which we complied with until we left holding for a successful approach and landing in ATL.

161,161,161,161,2522,The flight was uneventful until approximately 1 mile from the threshold. I was executing an ILS approach in MVFR conditions; with the runway in sight; in a stabilized approach at Vref +10 and slowing. With less than a half mile to touchdown; with the aircraft in controlled flight while hand-flying (without the autopilot) with the aid of flight director; glide slope; and localizer indicators functioning normally; and the runway in plain sight; the CAS system indicated a master warning of engine fire in both engines; with an aural warning of 'left engine fire.' I did not notice any roll back of engine power or sense a loss of power at that point; and do not remember issuing any commands to the PNF. Being in close proximity to the runway; I elected to continue to the runway without changing any power settings or making any attitude changes. The PNF called out that both engines were indicating 'fire;' to which I assumed that the aircraft was indeed on fire; though I did not smell smoke or see flames. The PNF notified the tower of [the] 'fire;' and then executed immediate memory items for engine fire procedures; up to and including arming fire bottles and depressing the fire extinguishing button for the left engine; to which I sensed engine loss by yaw. Fire indications continued; though the PNF did not execute a second engine shutdown procedure. I continued to fly the airplane to the runway; under the assumption that the aircraft was on fire. The airplane touched down within the displaced threshold and just prior to the runway end identifying stripe. I then executed hard braking; deployed both thrust reversers without adding power; and exited runway; coming to a stop just past the hold short line; all while engine fire indications were still illuminated. I instructed the PNF to egress the passengers; upon which he depressed the 'emergency decompression' push button; then left his seat and escorted the 2 passengers on board down the airstairs of the main entrance onto the runway and away from the aircraft. I remained inside the aircraft to secure it; power down; and egress myself. No smoke and no flame; nor any fire damage or scorching evidence was detected upon inspection by me or the airport personnel. The passengers were ferried by Airport Authority vehicles to the appropriate facilities; while the aircraft; after close inspection and securing; was towed to the company hangar. After careful study and analysis by the company Chief Mechanic; and through conversations with Bombardier engineers; and evaluations of on board computer data; it has been concluded that the engine fire detection and extinguishing system malfunctioned during a critical phase of flight (final approach to landing); sounding the 'engine fire alarm' through the CAS master warning system; causing the crew to react as if the airplane were actually on fire. Outcome was positive; with no aircraft damage and no aircraft fire; and no injuries during evacuation. I have been informed that this is a known malfunction; but that had not been addressed by the manufacturer adequately to operators of the CL35 aircraft. My corporate flight department has operated the CL30/35 aircraft for the past 14 years; without incident or occurrence of this nature; and without knowledge that this problem was known by the manufacturer.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

163,163,163,163,5722,I was asked to supervise and show two mechanics how to properly install a number 8 main landing gear tire on a Boeing 767-300 aircraft. I showed the [mechanics] how to properly look up in the aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) the procedures and tooling required and read through the AMM with them while a tire was being procured by our lead. I assisted the two [mechanics] in the process of removing and replacing the wheel assembly but failed to check the part number of the tire being installed. Having worked international line maintenance before; I am aware of the part number differences between the B767-300 and the B767-300ER tires. I feel that the distraction of training the two students; and assuming the lead AMT was providing me with the proper effective tire for the aircraft; distracted me from checking the part effectivity for myself. Then when entering the information into the log I again overlooked the fact that the wrong Part Number (PN) had been installed onto the aircraft. Though the incorrect tire was provided for me; ultimately I am responsible for the equipment that is being installed and signed for. I supervised and help[ed] perform the maintenance task; and signed off the aircraft maintenance log. I was unaware of my mistake until [about a month later] I was made aware of the discrepancy by the hangar shift manager and my lead; and was informed that the tracking system had logged the error in part effectivity and that I needed to sit and make a statement for the internal investigation into the matter. I brought my error to the attention of the two [mechanics] that I was training and emphasized the importance of checking PN effectivity with the aircraft that is being worked; regardless of who provides the part for them. I also explained that ultimately regardless of the situation; the mechanic performing and signing for the work is responsible for insuring the airworthiness and effectivity of the part being installed on the aircraft.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
164,164,164,164,9794,During take off; after the 80 KIAS call (at which time I noted both airspeed indicators passing 80 KIAS) just about the time the First Officer called V1; I noticed my airspeed indicator was rapidly decreasing.  I rotated and glanced down at my instruments and noticed only the ADI appeared normal.  I had no airspeed; vertical speed; or increasing altitude indications.  I looked over at the First Officer's side and all his looked normal; so I transferred control to him.  After assuming Pilot Not Flying duties; I had time to see flags through my ASI; VSI and Altimeter.  I selected ALTN ADC [Alternate Air Data Computer] and got all my instruments back.  I continued as Pilot Not Flying.  In the climb; EICAS message ATC FAIL displayed; followed by MACH/SPD TRIM and RUDDER RATIO with L ADC in ALTN; and the First Officer as Pilot Flying with auto pilot command.  These messages cleared as I was getting the QRH out.  Looking through the MACH AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE checklist I saw the note stating the above messages may occur while in ALTN ADC.  After the messages cleared all appeared normal.  We continued to cruise cross checking the altimeters.  A little while after being established at cruise (FL 380) the ASI command bug began moving beyond the barber pole and the auto throttles moved toward idle.  The First Officer disconnected the autopilot and the MACH/SPD TRIM and RUDDER RATIO messages re-appeared then cleared.  I told ATC we were not able RVSM and they cleared us to FL 280.  I contacted Dispatch to let them know what we were experiencing and to see if Maintenance Control had any ideas to resolve our problems.  Dispatch gave us a fuel burn update for FL 280.

We thought about adding gas but didn't because even though our FOD was lower than normal; we had enough fuel to do a go-around and still make our alternate. Enroute we fell slightly below our projected fuel. Approaching the point outside of the FAF; we were vectored in a 360 due to ATC spacing. By the time we got back on track and were once again a couple miles from FAF; the WX went below our 1000 RVR requirement. We diverted to our alternate. However; ATC turned us away from the field and had to be prompted that we needed to head for [the alternate] right now. I declared min fuel and said we cannot take any delays or vectors.

170,170,170,170,1835,We were made aware that we were planned to ferry an aircraft following a MX engine run-up. I was told by MX control that two of the left engine fan blades had 'dings' in them and that there was damage to the acoustical dampening material inside the cowl. After arriving to the airport; talking to the on-call mechanic; and inspecting the two damaged fan blades and the cowl ourselves; we agreed to conduct the MX run-up. The run-up was uneventful. I still had remaining questions about any limitations to fan blade damage. At first; MX control didn't know of any limitations. Then I was told .375 inches. I told them that one of the dings measured .5'x.5'; so that in itself was a 'nonstarter'. MX control then got on the line and angrily told me that there was no such limitation; I didn't need to know that info; and that they had taken aircraft with much worse damage and that if I didn't want to take the aircraft then we could take it up with our manager. I then requested a flight manager be put on the phone. A Manager was put into the conversation; then promptly 'shut down' the conversation after it was apparent that noting was going to be resolved. Twenty minutes later; the Manager called me from his personal number to discuss the matter. I requested that he have scheduling call me and we could three way the conversation so it could be recorded. We discussed the issue further and he said he was trying to get further information from other sources within the MX department regarding any limitations regarding the damage. Approximately an hour later; the Manager; myself; Maintenance Control; and a gentleman that claimed he was a CF34 'expert'; had a conference call and presented me with several pieces on information. I told them I would discuss it with my crew and call them back. As a crew; we decided that it was not safe to operate the aircraft in its current condition; and therefore refused to operate the flight on safety grounds. Our reasons were the following:1. We were getting several conflicting numbers from MX on the limits on what was an acceptable amount of damage for safe prolonged engine operation. We were told .375'; then told that was just for Part 121 passenger ops; and then that it could be blended down to .5'' as per GE. Then I believe they mentioned there was actually no limitations for damage. I find that hard to believe since every engineered material has a structural limitation before failure. Considering that the damage was .5'' unblended; and would not be blended prior to flight was not acceptable. Even if it was blended before flight; it would exceed that GE limitation.2. The larger 'ding' was a 'V' shaped chunk of the fan blade that was missing; not bent. I have no way of knowing what underlying damage might be present in that blade that is not visible to naked eye. With enough prolonged stress on that area; and without knowing the status of the structural integrity of the blade; we felt it was too much of a risk to operate that engine safely. The MX people were willing to sign it off based on cell phone pictures. Trust me when I say that seeing the damage in pictures and seeing in person don't even compare. It's hard to gain perspective from a cell phone picture.3. The damage to the acoustical liner and within the cowling was concerning. Whatever FOD was encountered was enough to create over a .5'' hole in the acoustical liner inside the cowling that appeared to penetrate the protective Kevlar shroud in the housing. All of these factors played into our decision as a crew that the aircraft could not be operated safely. After we told the parties jointly in a conference call; the CF34 'expert' demanded to know my background and how I could make that determination. As PIC; it is my job to take all of the information that is presented to me; and make an informed and safe decision. Certain personnel in your MX department do not like to give out information. This particular Maintenance Controller in particular. I don't like feeling like I'm being lied to; or that information is being kept from me. His accusation that 'I don't need to know' certain information is false and dangerous. It makes it look like he is hiding something. Second; I don't like how he talks to pilots; it is completely unprofessional. We can disagree and still remain professional. The same goes for the other gentleman and self-proclaimed CF34 'expert'. While he was professional in our initial conversation; his tone and antics turned sour after we refused the aircraft. I do not appreciate having my qualifications; experience; or judgment called into question like that. I will not be pressured into taking an aircraft that I do not think is safe to fly; and there were certain individuals that were trying to pressure me into accepting this aircraft by thinly veiled threats or coercion. I highly encourage the individuals on the ASAP committee to review all of the recorded conversations that took place between myself and the people involved.

One stated that it was hard to read the print when the adrenaline was pumping. -I would like to see flight and cabin crew emergency training accomplished together someday here; to focus on building crew coordination when an actual emergency arises.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

174,174,174,174,2577,While cruising at FL340 the B Flight Attendant called the flight deck and reported the aft lavatory smoke alarm was going off and there was a burnt electrical smell coming from the same area. We immediately donned our oxygen masks and established communications. In rapid succession we determined our location; the nearest airport; and told Center we needed to divert immediately. Center coordinated our turn to [divert airport] and descent with other aircraft in the area and we started down. We started the Smoke; Fire and Fumes Checklist in the QRH. The Captain flew the aircraft while the First Officer (FO) completed the checklist and communicated with the Flight Attendants. The Flight Attendants communicated with the Passengers about what was occurring. We [flew a] visual approach. We turned off the runway and had the Fire Department check the aircraft for any signs of a fire. The Captain made an announcement to the people about what was happening and what would happen next. The Fire Department determined there were no signs of a fire and cleared us to taxi to the gate. The FO called Ops to get a gate and we proceeded to the gate after receiving clearance from Ground Control. Once at the gate the Fire Department came onto the aircraft and checked for any signs of a fire. Once that was complete and the passengers were deplaned we called Dispatch and then Contract Maintenance. Upon talking with the Flight Attendants on the ground; the burnt electrical smell was evident anytime the aft closet was opened. Also; we learned the Flight Attendants searched through all of the trash and compartments looking for a fire source but did not find anything. The circuit breaker to the smoke detector was pulled once we were on the ground and cancelled the alarm. Contract Maintenance reset the circuit breaker and the alarm did not continue. The Contract Maintainer did not notice a burnt electrical smell until several of the ceiling panels in the aft galley were removed and he investigated in the ceiling area. The aircraft was turned over to Maintenance at this point to determine the issue. It was only 15 minutes from the time the alarm was reported to the time we landed. In that time we started the QRH Checklist and the FO reviewed all the items but there was not enough time to fully and completely finish the Smoke; Fire and Fumes Checklist.

We were going to do a turn back to ZZZ; so Maintenance asked to see what changes would happen to the engine parameters with the PMC's [Power Management Controllers] off.  At a steady state cruise; we turned off the PMC's and wrote down the engine parameters.  As we were descending; we slowly pulled the thrust levers back and looked at the engine parameters.  At approximately fifty percent N1 and passing 32;000 FT; we had two compressor stalls and the left engine rolled back.  We quickly turned the PMC's on and went through Engine Failure Shutdown Checklist.  The engine was still turning with oil pressure; so we elected to restart the left engine with a successful windmill restart.

178,178,178,178,5442,We had begun our descent into ZZZ. Was 5 1/2 hour flight from ZZZ1. I was the A Flight Attendant. I noticed a smell in the forward galley. It was slight when I first noticed it. I am new to flying on the Airbus and there are many new sounds; etc.; that are unfamiliar to me. So in my mind I think originally it was just a unique smell to the Airbus. However; once we passed 18;000 and pilots made arrival notice to prepare cabin; the smell began to get stronger and I began to have [a] headache. At 10;000 chime I was called by pilots and asked if I could smell odor in cabin; as they could smell in flight deck; and the smell was stronger. I told them that yes I could smell odor and tried to describe. They said to get crew secured and that we would be on ground in 5 minutes. The B and C were mid cabin doing final cleanup. I walked to mid cabin and could still smell the odor; but not as strong as in forward galley. Told my B and C to get seated and informed them what pilots had stated and asked if they could smell odor; and she said yes. We all took our jump seats. As we were landing; sitting in jump seat in forward galley; I tried to see where smell [was] coming from; like air vent; etc.; but I could not diagnose. Once on the ground and deplaned; crew all debriefed with pilots of the event and what we all smelled; etc. At this point I now had tighter chest and lungs and felt unstable a bit; but I did not get sick. No passengers made any comment to me regarding smell during [deplaning].

179,179,179,179,3746,I was copilot on flight ZZZ [mainland] to Kona. During preflight; the FMC routing was datalink loaded. The flight pub bag and FMC database were checked to be current. After uploading the winds; the runway and departure were loaded along with the runway in Kona. I did not load the arrival into Kona as I was taught adding the arrival will likely add distance to the flight and could potentially create fuel issues at the critical point. After passing the critical point I attempted to load the arrival and approach for Kona. However; we noticed that there were no arrivals or approaches available to load; only the runway. Further investigation found that there were no departures; arrivals; or approaches in the FMC for any Hawaii airport. We continued raw data on arrival and flew an uneventful ILS approach into Kona. We wrote a maintenance discrepancy in the logbook; notified maintenance via ACARS; and debriefed the mechanic upon arrival into Kona.Today (18 days later); the captain was informed that the aircraft was loaded with an Airbus navigation database and that is what accounted for the lack of coverage for Hawaii. I don't know how I would have caught this on preflight; or how long this plane had been flying with the wrong database.FYI; I had the same experience on Airport ZZZ2 to ZZZ3 [also Hawaii] (8 days ago). Again we flew raw data on the arrival and ILS approach for an uneventful landing. We wrote up the discrepancy and thoroughly debriefed maintenance upon arrival into ZZZ3. I never found out what the problem was but I suspect it was the same issue.

Test still failed. [I] landed with flaps 50. We were fairly light and had a 15 KT headwind. Light brakes were used to exit the runway. After landing; I had the airport fire trucks do a thermal scan of our brakes; to make sure that we did not have any hot; binding brakes. They said all brakes were well within normal limits. We taxied to our parking spot with no further problems. Several hours after the flight; I reviewed the checklist in an effort to 'debrief' the incident. Upon this review; I realized that I had misread one of the steps of the checklist procedure. The checklist said to turn the 'auto brakes off; if installed.' I mistakenly read it as 'anti skid off' and landed with the anti skid off. After the go around; we were fairly close to our 'emergency fuel.' Approach kept us in a tight pattern and I was finishing the checklist while on a 10 mile base. We were rushed; but with our fuel situation I did not feel that it was wise to delay much longer. I quickly went through the checklist again as the layout of the checklist is somewhat confusing. There are different steps for carbon brakes than for steel brakes; which we had that day. With the fuel situation in my mind; I rushed and misread the checklist. I think that the checklist is poorly written and confusing. A better layout; better type and font layout might help [also] having more fuel remaining to deal with problems that occur just before landing would help also.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
181,181,181,181,9344,After engine start; we noticed a mechanical problem that necessitated a return to the blocks. After coordinating with Ramp; we taxied back to the blocks. Immediately upon setting the parking brake; maintenance personnel approached the aircraft with stairs to board before either engine has been shut down. We shut down the engines; and before we could complete our checklists; the mechanics were already in the cockpit asking questions about the mechanical issue. Even at idle thrust these engines are dangerous and there was no need for ground crew to be approaching an aircraft before the flight crew has had an opportunity to shut down the engines. Two of them were wearing hats which could have easily been sucked into the operating engine; but their proximity to the engine could have had a much more devastating result.When we spoke to the crew and asked why they felt so hurried to approach the airplane; they told us that they weren't sure if we were going to shut down the engines and that they remained outside the yellow lines. If an aircraft returns to the blocks; there is no need to have Maintenance approach to board before engines have been shut down. While I understand that a mechanical delay can elicit a hurried response to get the aircraft in the air; there is no need to rush. Hasty reactions are very dangerous. Furthermore; it takes just a few minutes to shut down the engines and [to] allow the flight crew to finish their shutdown checklists. These 2 or 3 minutes are minimal to the often hour or so delay caused by a block turn back. As such; nothing can be gained by adding such unnecessary risk to the aircraft; or worse; to ground personnel. In such cases I believe it is imperative that before approaching any aircraft with the intent to board; and getting near an engine; that ground crew allows the flight crew time to perform their shutdown procedure and any necessary checklist(s).,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

186,186,186,186,4331,On downwind at least 18 miles out was being flashed by a very bright green laser aimed directly at the cockpit window. On approach with the laser blaring in our faces put the gear down to have a 2 line ECAM. AUTO BRKS on line 1 and NORM BRKS on line 2. Went missed approach at 10;000' and asked for delay vector while trying to relay the position of the laser to the tower and running the ECAM's. Went to the book and found the AUTO BRKS page which said to go to the adjusted landing distance table. Started looking for the NORM BRKS and never could find it in the book. Now running short on time and fuel with the laser still flashing us. Did not have time to call Dispatch or Maintenance and the landing distance says to add multiple failures together to get the correct required landing distance but nothing in the book for the NORM BRKS ECAM. We were WITHOUT guidance on an ECAM from our books. The only book reference was to adjust the landing distance as we have no auto brakes and no normal brakes and it had no guidance for the 2 failures. We are now test pilots. Decided to reset the Antiskid Switch even though there was no procedure calling for it! It worked and the ECAMs cleared off. After landing and talking with Maintenance it took another 20 minutes for them to figure out it was a failure of one of the BSCU computers. We had switched from the bad computer to the good computer by turning OFF and ON the antiskid switch with the gear up on the missed approach. The ECAM was misleading and totally worthless in helping to fix this issue as it said nothing about a BSCU failure. Lately however I have heard of numerous BSCU failures. The Captain had a picture of the number 1 and number 3 tires that he blew on landing with a failed BSCU. I had a total loss of nosewheel steering due to a failed BSCU that was not resettable in flight and had to have a tug at the runway to tow us to the gate just a couple weeks ago. The Mechanic said another 320 just blew some tires in landing a month ago on landing with a failed BSCU. The next day I called the Tower and delivered a street map with the exact streets where the laser was coming from so they stop the laser flasher. The Tower admitted that this was a common problem at this airport and even the Tower was lasered on a different occasion. Never before had anyone given the Tower a map with the street address so they were very happy and surprised because they were thinking it was in a different location.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
187,187,187,187,2895,We started the day with an auto-brake fault MEL. The manual brakes worked normally; we simply couldn't use the auto-brakes. After takeoff; we received the brakes auto brake fault ECAM; with brake released below it. We were expecting the brakes auto brake fault ECAM; but not the brakes released because in the original MEL; it stated that it cannot be displayed to legally dispatch the plane.We ran the ECAM procedures. After going thru the QRC; QRH and Aircraft Operating Manual (AOM); we learned that at least one wheel will be released. This was the primary concern because we didn't know if multiple wheels would not be braking.The Captain did all of the communicating with dispatch and maintenance. Then the confusion came getting landing numbers. The inflight performance for the A320 has performance numbers for the auto brake fault and dispatch was able to give us numbers with one brake released. But they couldn't give us numbers for 2 brakes or more released. They were discussing our current MEL with the new issue and no one was able to explain if more than one brake would be released.The landing airport was calling for rain and with about 7;600 feet available for landing. With one brake released we needed about 5;600 feet to stop. What we didn't know is if more than one brake was going to be released. This resulted in us [advising ATC] and diverting to another airport to use their long runway.There is so much that can be learned from this event. We tried to use every available resource to make the best decision we could with what we knew at the time. And of course safety is always number one. I have just learned that for the A320; the auto brake numbers take into account for one wheel to be released. What I also didn't know is that if a second wheel was released there would have been a second ECAM.We actually talked about this during the flight of how we would know if 2 or more wheels were released and we simply didn't know. According to the AOM; it was entirely possible more than 1 brake could be released. If we just knew that; we would have been so much more comfortable with the situation. I also learned to just stick with the ECAM and don't assume more things can be broken than what the airplane tells you.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

189,189,189,189,1185,Ground operations were relatively uneventful except for some discrepancies with the aircraft upon arrival.  APU was running and ground power was on the aircraft; there was 300 pounds of fuel in the center tank and there was a 400 pounds split in the mains with the left side lower.  I discussed with the FO our cost saving measures which require waiting to start the APU.  I elected to run the APU off of a right main with cross feed open in order to balance fuel prior to takeoff.  Our release was scheduled for 10;500 pounds but we had 12;000 pounds in the tanks and was surprised the release was not accurate.  The FO and I discussed TO and Landing data; fuel distribution; and the location of center body fuel pumps as well as the requirement to monitor the cockpit if center pumps are used. We also discussed the need to be extra vigilant when flying into or out of ZZZ or ZZZ1 due to maintenance and storage at those locations.  Forms review revealed [seats] X 1; 2; 3 power ports inoperative and I requested the gate agent re-seat the passengers from X1 AND X2 prior to boarding.  FO did the walk around about 20-15 minutes prior to departure.  On return I asked if he saw the pumps in the wheel well; since no one had shown them to him; we went out quickly and I pointed 4 fuel pumps accessed from the wheel well.  The rest of ground operations appeared uneventful.  We pushed back 5 minutes early with no abnormal last chance from the ground crew and then we were give a controlled TO time due to flow control into ZZZ2.We were cleared for Takeoff and as PF I hand flew the aircraft to approximately 12-15;000 feet and then engaged the left autopilot.  After level off we were cleared direct ZZZZZ (feeder fix for ZZZZZ ZZZ2).  During cruise @ FL220 I burned the 300 pounds from center tank and cross fed to balance mains.  At approximately 20 minutes after TO; while in cruise I notice the CA and FO altimeters were 'bouncing' about 20 feet standby was normal and all 3 airspeed indicators agreed.  We discussed possible mountain wave; or some static port icing. Airspeed was stable but we set 280 KIAS then we set 290 KIAS for STAR transition.  Then we were cleared ZZZZZ and I set 270 KIAS to match STAR restriction. Then 20 miles prior to top of descent we were given 'descend via ZZZZZ4'.  I set 6000 feet in the MCP and verified VNAV path and executed the 'descend now' for 1000 VVI to capture the path.  Then CA and FO altimeters were about 20 feet different and they were about 250-300 feet from the standby altimeter. During the descent we were given 17;000 then stopped at 11;000 feet then direct ZZZZZ for XXL then Descend and maintain 5;000 feet.During the descent; the split from standby altimeter was reduced and the bounce seemed to quicken and lessen.  By 7;000 feet it had disappeared completely.  All indications were normal.  We configured Flaps 30 degrees Brakes 2 with a standard landing assessment.  I disengaged the autopilot at about 1;000 feet and the landing rollout and taxi back to X22 were uneventful.I had failed to sign the logbook prior to flight. So; after flight I reviewed the last 7-10 days to see if there were any similar write-ups.  I saw the aircraft sat for 3 days.  I didn't notice anything else in the logbook and signed it.I met the oncoming CA on the jet bridge and discussed what I saw.  I offered to write it in the logbook if he wanted and he declined.  I said it was a little weird but seemed to self correct and didn't want to waste Maintenance time on something that they 'could not duplicate.'  Later I received a call from a safety representative and was told about an air return for an unreliable airspeed / altitude.  We agreed I should have written up the event in the log book and this is the reason for my report.Causal factors include:1: Maintenance procedure not complied with or annotated in logbook.2: Aircraft repositioning crew failed to notice static blockage.3: Inattention to detail. Flight crewfailed to notice static blockage during walk around.4: Low sun angle and Jet bridge may have partially obscure view of blockage.5: Ground push crew failed to notice blockage during ground operation.6: Arrival ground crew failed to notice blockage.7: PIC failed to make a logbook entry regarding altitude anomalies even though they appeared to self correct.8: Ground/Maintenance failed to notice blockage and PIC did not do a post flight inspection after having knowledge of the possible problem with the static ports.Suggestions:1: Write up any abnormal indications and let maintenance determine if it's acceptable or not.2: Be extra vigilant because airplanes are being stored and they break more often.3: ZZZ is a maintenance base; so consider an early show and have both pilots do the walk around.4: Focus!  Many FOs are distracted with job security.5: PIC post flight. Take the extra minute to do a post flight walk around after an event like this or one requiring a write-up.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
190,190,190,190,5962,Hardware left out of flap fairing; causing an air return. I was multitasking and missed the inboard screws. Aircraft was removed from service for repairs.This is a description of my day that lead up to Aircraft X air return. Came into work clock in; got a paper to see what plane and work load was going to be happening that night. I was told after the meeting that I was assigned outside with heavy flaps and aileron backlash which these task on any other day are assigned by one person performing the backlash and another doing the outside. The plane arrived at the hangar and the line and routine check was started and signed off. The first thing that I started was the aileron backlash. [Another technician] and I preformed that backlash and completed that task. By this time I was wanting to get started on the heavy flaps because it can take time to get the panels off; and I knew as soon as I got done that I would be sent over to help another Mechanic out due to him not preforming his assigned tasks in a timely manner. I started pulling the right hand flap fairings for inspection and lube. The fairing screws where over tightened and some striped so that requires you to drill them out which takes time. Got the fairings off and started to pull that aft because you remove them to get the flap panels loose for the inspector to check them. Process done on top of the other things that need to be done on the A-Check and potable water sanitize forward and aft. A mechanic that was sent over said that he could only help for a bit because he had to take his aircraft to the gate so it could depart; he pulled wheel bins and done strut pressures for me; another mechanic was sent over and done the water sanitation. At this time the fairings are off and I go to get a grease gun to do the lubrication of the flaps and landing gear the grease guns where inop and needed to be put together. While the Inspector was inspecting the flaps I started on other job cards that are assigned to the A- Check the Inspector came to me and said that he was done with his inspection. With the inspection being done I put the flap fairings on and get the other tasks done so we could make gate in a timely manner instead of getting to the gate late. I started putting the flap fairings on and got almost done and seen that other things needed to be done so I went and done those task and came back and finished the flap fairings. The flap fairings being done which would prove otherwise not to be done; I moved on to finish other things that where needing to be done still thinking in the back of my head that I was going to be sent over to help that certain mechanic out as everyone has done or seen happen. I can't really think of what else I need to say other than I need to slow down double check my work.I know that what I done cause people to misconnecting flights for work or family I take 100% of the responsibility for this. I think it was the possibility of being sent over to help someone that won't put forth any effort into his job me rushing myself to complete two jobs that normally has two people assigned to it who know all I know is that I was the one that left the screws out of the aft fairing I do put a lot of pressure on me to be a good work that everyone can depend on.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

193,193,193,193,2300,I departed for my second break-in flight on a freshly overhauled engine. The break-in procedure instructed me to fly below 6;000 MSL in order to keep manifold pressure as high as possible so the piston rings will seat properly; and make power changes every 30 minutes (for 1 to 5 minutes) before returning to max cruise settings. My first break-in flight showed me that 5;500 MSL would not quite produce 24 inches of manifold pressure (26.5 is max cruise setting) so I intended to stay lower on the next flight. I planned to fly West; over the railroad tracks with a touch and go at ZZZ and ZZZ1 then return. Because that route is over sparsely populated areas I decided that I would fly at 500 AGL to keep the manifold pressure up. This was my first mistake: my airplane does not give altitude readings in AGL; I was basing my altitude decision on airport altitudes enroute with no thought about the actual terrain around these airports. For some reason that didn't occur to me before this flight. So after take-off I climbed to 4;700 MSL and set the autopilot to hold that altitude and followed the railroad tracks. As I approached ZZZ I reduced power for the touch and go and switched the radio to get the weather there; as I set the pressure altitude I noticed the cylinder head temperature starting to climb. This became my focus for the duration of the flight- I became so distracted by this temperature reading I basically forgot to fly the airplane. My initial response was to increase the fuel mixture and begin a descent to increase the airflow; when that didn't lower the CHT I broke off the approach and put it in a shallow climb and returned to the railroad tracks headed West. This is where I became more of a passenger than a pilot. I could not take my focus off the CHT; I utilized the autopilot to maintain heading and I tried to keep it in a shallow climb while I watched the temp gauge. The autopilot hunted left then right doing its best to hold heading so I disconnected the autopilot and hand flew; eventually reaching 4;700 MSL and watching the CHT gradually decreasing. Then I realized I needed to go higher because the altitude at ZZZ is 4;400 MSL; I should be at a minimum of 4;900. At this point I recognized that I was too far behind the plane and made the only good decision that day- I turned back. Unfortunately my focus was still on that CHT gauge; and I still had to figure out how to land the plane without the CHT going to redline. So I tried some different power settings on the way back; as I approached ZZZ3 I started a simulated approach to monitor the effect on CHT. Reducing the RPM first seemed to help keep the CHT from rising as quickly and beginning the descent at the same time helped even more. But now I realized I was too low again; ZZZ3 is 4;500- I should have been at 5;000 MSL to be at least 500 AGL. I was not prepared for this flight; I should have spent more time flight planning; I took for granted that it was just a local flight for engine break-in; this should have been treated like any other cross country flight. Because I was focused on the engine break-in rather than the actual flight I almost became the next CFIT statistic. Every flight should be treated with the same level of planning regardless of the reason for the flight.,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Once the speed brake was stowed to 25 percent it rolled again to the right 15 degrees and then it went wings level again.  After the speed brakes were fully stowed; the aircraft rolled left 15 degrees and then back to wings level.

Upon departing we experienced a Master Caution message indicating an anti-skid failure. This caution message occurred after rotation and remained illuminated for approximately 5 seconds before it extinguished. The remainder of the flight was continued to destination and a visual approach was initiated. The pilot flying; completed a base to final turn and was stabilized and on speed by 1;000 feet. Upon touchdown; he applied the brakes; however the aircraft braking did not engage and no deceleration was observed. I also put max brake pressure on and felt no deceleration. The brake pedals provided no feedback and felt as if they were stuck in position. Thrust reversers were deployed to maximum and I initiated the emergency memory items for a brake failure on landing. I turned off the anti-skid system and immediately applied maximum braking due to only having approximately 1;500 feet of runway remaining. The aircraft began to decelerate and the rear tires were skidding. A slight loss of direction control was noticed and the aircraft came to a stop with approximately 500-600 feet of runway remaining. Both rear tires burst and the aircraft was resting on the rims. I completed a shutdown checklist and exited the aircraft.

199,199,199,199,3497,I operated an aircraft that was later discovered to be not airworthy at the time I took-off. After flying aircraft to an away-from-base Maintenance Facility and extensively studying the logbooks for the aircraft which was rented from a local flight school; it was discovered that there were a number of omitted logbook entries and other missing or incomplete paperwork for the aircraft. An aileron was re-skinned and re-painted with form 337 only partially being completed and without a copy being forwarded to the local FSDO. Additionally; there was no logbook record of the repaired aileron being removed or for it being reinstalled on the aircraft or for the aileron's balance being checked after painting; though the repairs were clearly accomplished. In the course of providing background information to the repair facility; we investigated a number of components in the aircraft's charging system which had been burning-out voltage regulators; circuit breakers; and alternators on a regular basis for over a year. We discovered that the alternator installed in the aircraft was of twice the capacity of that approved for the aircraft. The over-sized alternator was according to the logbook; first installed when the aircraft's engine was replaced with an overhauled engine in 2009--when the alternator problems began (determined only with the benefit of hindsight). I do not believe the erroneous installation was intentional; though it has been costly; and apparently dangerous; for everyone involved. Subsequent replacements; accomplished by numerous facilities; merely replaced the part number of the removed component without verifying its approval for the aircraft's serial number.During further research we came to the conclusion that although the particular oversize alternator was not approved for that specific year and serial number of aircraft; because of extensive avionics upgrades; (the addition of a heated pitot tube; and the addition of anti-collision strobes all done in 2005) an alternator of additional capacity would actually be required to maintain sufficient electrical power to the aircraft's electrical buses during a maximum load condition--especially likely in IMC. It was also discovered that the alternator field breaker was wrong by any criteria used; the alternator main-breaker was undersized for the alternator output; the alternator wiring was grossly undersized for the output capacity of the installed unit; and the ammeter (now mysteriously shunted) was not able to meter the rated capacity of the installed alternator.Though; thankfully the only damages were monetary; clearly such an installation was a fire hazard and not airworthy. Unapproved methods; techniques; and practices were evidently used to accomplish some of the upgrades performed in 2005; and this is an underlying factor in the ongoing maintenance issues this aircraft has experienced. Routine maintenance like oil changes and tire changes performed by one of the flight school's experienced instructors; although performed in accordance with applicable airworthiness standards were never recorded in either the airframe's or engine's logbooks. The instructor's--emphasis on was--the person in charge of maintaining the airworthiness of the aircraft and evidently put greater stock in flying the aircraft as much as possible; than maintaining a safe and airworthy aircraft--particularly with respect to completing the paperwork. Again with the benefit of hindsight; I realized that this instructor exhibits an 'anti-authority' hazardous attitude. That attitude has endangered the safety of myself and other people who have operated the aircraft and indirectly led to my operating an un-airworthy aircraft.My own failure to personally verify the airworthiness of the aircraft beyond verifying tach time with upcoming inspection times as posted on the bulletin board and verifying that the AROW documents and TOMATO FLAMES [acronyms] equipment were present; directly resulted inthis infraction. It is worth noting though; that the steps I took are standard industry practice for renting aircraft and this is a safety issue that ought to be addressed--I was appalled to learn of the actual state of repair of this beautiful looking; beautiful flying aircraft. Flight students should really get more instruction about how to determine the airworthiness status of an aircraft than they currently do because they are the ones ultimately responsible! It was only after experiencing a charging system failure in IMC in the aircraft that I became more familiar with the ongoing problems and I ultimately lent my expertise as a skilled troubleshooter and dug deep into records that I discovered the depth of the underlying problem; sloppy maintenance.From this narrative it may be evident that I operated the aircraft more than once prior to learning of its true airworthiness status and that it had been continually un-airworthy since at least 2009. Additionally; numerous other people have operated the aircraft during the time it was un-airworthy. None of the occurrences were intentional in any way; to enumerate them would be an onerous and unproductive task. All discrepancies on the aircraft have been satisfactorily corrected; the charging system has been completely upgraded; the person in charge of maintenance has been replaced; and a fantastic working relationship with an exceptional maintenance facility has been developed for the future.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

204,204,204,204,6150,I was working Radar/Satellite and Controller in Charge (CIC) in a combined tower configuration. A co-worker was working Local Control; Ground Control; and Flight Data combined in the tower. [Airport Operations] made an initial call for clearance on to Taxiway Alpha and Runway 22 for surface inspections. Ground Control cleared [Airport Operations] on to the requested taxiway and Runway 22. Aircraft X called ready for taxi and received instructions from Ground Control. Aircraft X was cleared for takeoff on Runway 22. [Airport Operations] called Ground Control and advised that he had never been told to exit the runway for the departing aircraft. After learning what had happened; Ground Control asked that [Airport Operations] call the tower at his first convenience. On the phone; [Airport Operations] advised that he was clear of the runway only because he was monitoring the frequency while working and quickly exited upon hearing Local Control issue a takeoff instruction.It is important to note that in this incident; the individual working Local; Ground; and Flight Data did not follow a local procedure and failed to use the required [reminder aid] when someone has been given clearance on to an active runway. As Controller in Charge I did not hear him issue a vehicle clearance on to the runway because I was performing CIC functions and working a position. Due to me not hearing the initial clearance on to the runway; no [reminder aid] being used and not a single other transmission being made to the truck between the time he was given clearance on to the runway and Aircraft X being cleared; no 'flag' was raised on my part as to (A) why the [reminder aid] was not being utilized as required and (B) why a takeoff instruction had been given with a vehicle on the departure end of Runway 22.All personnel must use required [reminder aid] devices at all times. I feel that a CIC combined with a position is ineffective. This is a perfect example. It is not practical to assume that a person working a position and performing required CIC duties can 100 percent monitor other operations for safety.

We have a Skywatch onboard and keep a close eye on it especially in the New York area at low altitudes. I had just finished arming my flight director to capture the inbound course when I looked out the window and saw us heading for a glider which was circling over an area. I don't believe this aircraft ever saw us. I don't believe he was equipped with a transponder either. I immediately took action and turned the aircraft to the left to avoid him.

They operate there knowing it is a bad location and does not want to sign an LOA with us because 'no matter what we have to provide services'. Area X is under multiple routes that IFR aircraft have to use to go enroute or just to land at COS. Also Area X is in the middle of a practice area that all VFR aircraft want to operate in. In this particular situation Aircraft Y was in the way of the descent of Aircraft X. The controller issued traffic to both; but both did not get each other in sight. So the controller stopped the descent of the Aircraft X. The response is 'blocked' try again 'blocked.' These are not one time offenses. This pilot always does this. Either blatantly ignores instructions or casually say blocked to pretend that they didn't hear it. I've recommended that they hold jumpers because they have jets underneath them. Their response is 'we are jumping in 1 minute'. What do I do? Kill myself trying to move everyone out of the way for them? Putting all the other aircraft in dangerous situations or proximity because they don't want to wait 2 minutes to let the aircraft pass? Luckily yelling on frequency and being unprofessional seemed to stop them. But of course that opens me up to other problems. Get NTSB on it; or something.

Beech 1900 reported no traffic observed and was issued a turn to heading 120 for traffic. Beech 1900 then reported traffic in sight and was instructed to maintain visual separation from the VFR traffic and a turn when able to heading 140. Beech 1900 read back instructions. Baron 58 was level at 040 on a converging heading with Beech 1900. The Controller was unable to exchange converging traffic information due to Beech 1900 reporting that previously issued VFR traffic had turned 'into him' and he was climbing to avoid. The Controller informed Beech 1900 unable a climb due to converging traffic at 040 and advised Beech 1900 to turn left/right or descend immediately. Beech 1900 reported unable as climb had already been initiated and was level at 033. Traffic was issued to Baron 58 about converging B1900 traffic but no read back was given. Beech 1900 then reported descending to 030 and VFR traffic no factor. The Controller reissued traffic to both Beech 1900 and Baron 58 for converging headings. Approximately 5 minutes later the VFR target was observed tracking northeast and climbing; when the aircraft called and requested practice approaches and identified himself.

213,213,213,213,10172,My student and I were returning to the home airport from the local practice area after a training flight. Since this was the student's 2nd training flight; I was explaining the correct traffic pattern entry and radio calls to him. I made the initial radio call 10 miles away from the airport and stated location; altitude and intentions. A short time later; a Mooney checked on to the CTAF and announced his location and intentions. I noted to myself that the Mooney was near us; but behind and decided to be vigilant. The wind favored landings on Runway XX that day; which meant that we would have to fly from the practice area to the northwest of the airport to an area southwest of the airport in order to make the 45 degree entry to the right traffic. I was a bit concerned as the student and I were flying in a Cessna 150 which is very slow and was worried about being overtaken by the faster Mooney as we both set up for the traffic pattern entry. I made my next radio call at a location approximately 4-5 miles northwest of the airport and stated that we intended to maneuver for the 45 degree entry to the traffic pattern. I also directed the student to descend to traffic pattern altitude. I continued to visually scan for the Mooney. Since I expected the Mooney to overtake us and since the right of way rules state that overtaking aircraft should pass on the right; I spent most of my time searching on our right. The pilot of the Mooney made a radio call and stated a position and distance from the airport that was very similar to ours. I became even more concerned about the possibility for a collision and made an additional radio call with our revised position and stated that we were in a Cessna 150; in an attempt to inform the Mooney pilot of our speed and the possibility for collision. The pilot of the Mooney made another radio call and stated his position; which was very similar to ours; 5 miles west of the airport. I became very concerned about the situation and began to aggressively scan for them. I didn't feel that it would be appropriate to divert towards the airport; as it would cause me to conflict with the traffic pattern. I also didn't feel that it would be appropriate to divert away from the airport; as I expected the Mooney to pass on the right. A very short time later; the Mooney passed by us on our left and slightly above us. It appeared to me that we were vertically separated by less than 200 feet and laterally separated by less than 200 feet.I realized after the fact; that I had allowed myself to continue into the possibility of a collision because I felt I had the right of way as the slower aircraft and because I did not want to cause my student an undue expense of maneuvering away from the airport. I noted that the other pilot made three radio calls that expressed essentially the same position and distance from the airport; yet I made no attempt to escape the situation. In the future; I will be more aggressive about maneuvering out of or away from potential traffic pattern conflicts.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

After my run-up I heard 'Jumpers Away'; and I'm not sure if it was 13;000 ft or 18;000 ft; or one of each. I'm not a jumper; and have no idea how long from Jumpers Away to airport traffic area so I called on the CTAF and asked if there was time for me to take off. I couldn't see anyone when I looked up; although of course my view was not clear.  One of the jump plane pilots said yes. I immediately commenced takeoff roll.

221,221,221,221,9917,I have flown commercially and privately at VGT for [many] years. Recently the calm runways changed from the standard 7 and 12 L/R to using 30 L/R which renders 7/25 useless for traffic. Practice IFR approaches are on 12 which is a conflict with aircraft departing 30 and doing pattern work. Even with a tailwind 30 L/R is still being used. Having worked in airline management and training pilots I cannot understand the reason for this. I am writing a safety report for the third time in my entire career because I believe there will be a fatal crash at VGT in the future if there are no changes. In addition; controllers are being trained which is understandable but their supervisors are not taking over early enough when there is a problem developing.Recently I intended to do touch and goes. The tower told me to fly runway heading then called my crosswind. I was at pattern altitude of 3000 MSL. A cessna approaching the airport from the west over the departure end of 30L was also at 3000 feet and closing. The TCAS warned me and I dove 400 feet to avoid a direct collision then saw him fly overhead at 3000 feet. I told the Tower who by then had taken over for the trainee controller and told me to fly to the [local landmark] then called my base turn. On a base descent for landing a helicopter flew directly in front of me who I also had to avoid. I again told the tower what had just happened then said I would just land instead of a touch and go.A week before; another pilot who was flying with me and observing traffic had a similar situation and instead of doing touch and goes decided it was too dangerous at that point and landed. We are both really concerned because we fly out of VGT; practice there and agree there is a real safety problem.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

After leveling at FL430; the airspeed began to degrade rapidly along with a rapid increase in AOA. We requested an immediate descent to FL400. ATC informed us that there was a Falcon at our 4 o'clock position and that we would have to wait for proper separation. Both my co-pilot and I had visual contact with the Falcon and began an immediate descent to counter the impending stall. We immediately contacted ATC again and told them that we could not maintain FL430 and had started a descent and also advised them that we had visual contact with the falcon.Following an additional review of the AFM and POM; there is no reason the aircraft; should not have been able to climb to and maintain FL430 at that time.

223,223,223,223,10468,Aircraft X was in my airspace and on my frequency eastbound at 35000 ft. He had just been transferred from ZDV Sector 17 and was only about 15 miles into my airspace. ZDV Sector 17 initiated an automated point out for Aircraft Y at 35000 ft. and initiated a radar handoff with ZKC Sector 24 eastbound in direct conflict with Aircraft X. I used the landline and called ZDV 17 and requested Aircraft Y turned 30 degrees to the right. He cheerfully said he would. ZKC Sector 24 shortly thereafter took the handoff which did not have any fourth line data indicating the turn. I did not approve the point out for Aircraft Y. Someone then entered Runway 30R in the fourth line data. I used the quick look function and saw that ZDV had already transferred communications for Aircraft Y to ZKC Sector 24 even though no coordination had been accomplished with me for Aircraft Y to transition my airspace without a transfer of communication. I called ZKC 24 and asked if he was talking with Aircraft Y. He said that he was and I asked him if he would 'fix it because that's not going to work.' I knew the 30 degrees probably wasn't enough but I wanted to get his turn started before deciding how much further the aircraft needed turned. ZKC 24 ended up using another 20 degrees of turns for a total of 60 degrees to ensure the aircraft did not have a midair collision. ZDV handing off deals to ZKC is a DAILY occurrence. I tried to resolve the conflict but was not able to because I did not have communications with the aircraft entering my airspace without permission. When I called ZDV; I could have said Radar Contact which may have alleviated the situation. I never heard ZDV call ZKC Sector 24 so I believe ZDV 17 violated ZKC 24 as well by turning an aircraft they had the handoff on without prior coordination. This was an extremely unsafe situation that was totally avoidable; which is what I attempted to do. At no point was ZDV given permission to enter my airspace without a transfer of radio communication for [Company]. I recommend the Controller be de-certified so that they can learn how Air Traffic functions and to prevent a collision in the NAS. Everything else we have tried to get through to them on not transferring communications/radar of an aircraft until known conflicts are resolved has not worked. I don't want it to take a mid-air collision before someone gets serious and makes that specific ZDV area understand the rules as stated in the FAAO but I feel like that's where we are at.

225,225,225,225,5593,Company ground vehicles failure to yield to taxiing/towed aircraft. Ground crew procedural non-compliance; Miami gate has a 30-degree angled approach due to fixed facilities and adjacent construction proximity which requires a final 30 degree turn relatively close to the gate. To avoid hazardous high powered settings in the final aligning turn; aircraft momentum must be maintained when initiating the turn. Just as I was about to initiate the aligning left turn; a belt loader driven by a man in a company uniform drove rapidly; and entirely into the Safe Gate clear area and into the area where the right wing and engine were about to be swung. The aircraft was stopped abruptly and there was no telling where the belt loader would go next (historically in MIA; I have had belt loaders drive up the forward cargo compartment and attempt opening the door with the engines running and a couple if times even with the aircraft still moving)! Our flight manual strictly prohibits this equipment inside the clear lines and I was not about to initiate a turn without momentum. The engines were shut down to prevent engine FOD from ground equipment or personnel. Ramp Control was notified of our requirement for a tow to parking and I requested a Ramp Manager come to the gate. I asked the Ramp Manager for the name of the employee who had violated the safe area but he refused but gave his own name. The ground crew then asked for the brake release and I told them I would once two pieces of equipment were moved outside the clear area lines. When the brake was released and the aircraft began movement; a couple of vehicles drove rapidly directly in front of the aircraft. I directed the driver to stop the tow and observed no wing walkers present. Where was the Ramp Manager? I then instructed the driver to get some wing walkers (to help stop traffic). I suspect that two are required by ramp operation procedures. Some time during the process he driver asked me; 'do you want to get to the gate or not?' I take this comment as a reflection of his view that basic ramp safety procedures are a nuisance instead of the fundamental way we conduct our business.

Conflict alert activated and I noticed Aircraft X turned east directly towards Aircraft Y. I turned Aircraft Y to a 090 heading to avoid. This incident occurred because Sector 1 and Sector 2 and Finals where combined with too much volume to safely run the amount of traffic at the time. At the time we had no one on break do to having the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) opened and reduced staffing levels for COVID.

234,234,234,234,3,We were on a 6 mile final when tower cleared a Cirrus to land in front of us. When this happened separation from the traffic began to decrease; tower then cleared the Cirrus for a low approach. This seemed to cause confusion in the Cirrus cockpit. We continued until the spacing was unsafe; the Cirrus appeared to be on the runway. At around 400 ft. we executed a go around. As we began to climb at go around thrust flaps 8 the Cirrus began to climb as well giving us a TA and tower asked us to side step to the right. I began a turn to the right as the pilot monitoring watched the traffic below us carefully. While our focus was on avoiding the traffic we neglected to call 'positive rate' and raise the gear. This led to a delay is raising the flaps form 8 to 0 to clean up the airplane. Since we were already at pattern altitude we made the decision to leave the gear down since we were moments away from needing to lower it again. Towers poor spacing was the initial cause of the event. However our focus on keeping visual separation from the traffic led us to neglect some of our duties. Although traffic avoidance was and should be our top priority in that situation. We could have called a go around earlier when we saw that there could be a potential conflict.

235,235,235,235,4416,I was practicing landings in Aircraft X [and] completed 6 with Flight Instructor and did 2 solo landings. ZZZ is an uncontrolled airport; fairly busy; and there was a lot of radio traffic. During the time I was flying left-hand patterns; there was a helicopter practicing landings in a right-hand pattern and was turning base over the numbers which made him very difficult to see. Also; I did not hear a radio call from the helicopter for his base turn or his turn to final. I don't know if the pilot didn't make the radio call or if he was covered by other radio transmissions. My instructor pilot confirmed that he did not hear the call either. Once I rotated on takeoff I heard 'he's 300 ft. above' but that was the only part of the call I heard. It's my understanding that the helicopter may - and I emphasize may; because I did not see him - aborted his landing and executed a right crosswind turn.

I gave a quick scan of the runway and cleared the aircraft for departure on a runway heading forgetting about the vehicle that had been working for several minutes. Shortly after the aircraft had started his takeoff roll both the Ground Controller and one of the visitors said the vehicle was still on the runway. I cancelled the Citabria's takeoff clearance and held his position on the runway. He resumed his departure roll once the vehicle had cleared the runway and I had given him a takeoff clearance. I would recommend a thorough scan of the runway prior to clearing anybody for takeoff. I had just done a quick scan and missed the vehicle because it was parked along the edge of the runway.

237,237,237,237,3623,I was doing take offs and landings at ZZZ using runway XX. I announced departing runway XX and remaining in the pattern. As I was turning downwind a Cessna 182; Aircraft Y announced he was taking off on runway YY. I looked at the runway and he was really departing on runway XX; not YY. I didn't correct him because I was the only one in the pattern and I thought he just miss-spoke. I had him in sight the whole time. After I did several landings I heard Aircraft Y report 9 miles southwest of the airport and he said he was going to land on runway YY. I told him that XX was the runway being used; and he replied that he would enter a downwind for XX.I did another landing and as I reported turning downwind Aircraft Y reported that he would enter the downwind for XX on the 45. I was wondering how he was going to do that if he was southwest of the airport. As I was on the downwind approaching abeam the numbers of XX; I saw Aircraft Y pass in front of me about 100 feet above and 200 feet horizontally. I watched him pass in front of me and then he reported turning downwind for runway XX. I told him he just flew a crosswind for Runway YY and cut across the downwind for XX. I turned base and final for XX and asked Aircraft Y for his location. He reported crosswind for XX; which I was able to confirm.

At first I thought it was a big airplane some distance away but quickly saw that it was a high wing Cessna on a reciprocal heading. I pointed the Cessna out to the First Officer and I started a left turn to avoid it around 1;500 ft. and we got an RA to level off below 2;000 ft. followed by a RA to descend. (We never got a 'traffic' alert or warning.) First Officer noticed minimum vertical separation of 300 ft. I estimate that our minimum horizontal clearance was less than a mile.

241,241,241,241,3439,I was working Local Control and recall working a trickier session than normal (perhaps it had been awhile since I had worked a busier session on this configuration). I had issued Aircraft Y a clearance to land on 12L and he was entering the left base. Aircraft X was cleared touch and go on 12R and was on a right base entry. In my scan; I suddenly noticed Aircraft X making a steep turn out the window; as if they were taking evasive action. I realized I had not exchanged traffic between the two aircraft; and simultaneously Aircraft Y was asking about the intentions of Aircraft X off his right; noting it appeared he was headed for him. I confirmed that the other aircraft was inbound on the parallel runway; and Aircraft X advised they overshot the final and were making a turn back to it. Each aircraft continued without expressing further concern.I can recall there was some complexity with local pattern traffic leading up to the event; where I was having difficulty tracking a helicopter in the local pattern that was flying patterns that were higher than normal. Aircraft Y also had an issued with their transponder and this created additional workload while they were inbound. I found it challenging at times to scan some of my traffic; as I did realize upon assuming the position that some of the shades in the cab were not in a 'normal' configuration and thus some areas were darker/lighter than normal. It was obvious when traffic was lighter later and I could make adjustments - but during a busier; complex period - I could not initially understand the lighting conditions affected by the shades were making it harder to track traffic in my pattern. The temperature also seemed warmer than usual and was distracting until it was adjusted. These environmental factors are not an excuse for overlooking traffic in this scenario (and it is my responsibility to make adjustments to either correct those factors or work through them) - but they may have played a role by making it challenging to work through a higher complexity traffic situation by putting me behind issuing a traffic advisory that I normally would have covered. Exchanging traffic sooner can help the pilots perform their duties in a VFR pattern and avoid these situations. While I usually try to be proactive and issue traffic as timely as I can; I overlooked it in this instance. I believe traffic complexity and frequency congestion - in conjunction with some environmental items mentioned above - were factors that made it more challenging to keep up and contributed to this oversight. I am reminded it is important to make environmental adjustments during periods of slower activity or prior to assuming a control position (equipment settings; temperature; shades; etc.) and have other tower team members assist with these when appropriate; in order to help prevent environmental factors adding to complexity when traffic builds.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
242,242,242,242,2304,I landed on Runway 14 after a visual approach; following a C-172.There were two departures waiting to take off and several others in the pattern waiting to land. Upon touchdown the Local Controller told me to 'keep it rolling' down the runway to exit at Taxiway Alpha; and then in the same transmission cleared a waiting plane to depart before I fully cleared the runway. (Anticipating separation)I pulled just beyond the Taxiway A hold line heading towards the GA ramp and stopped. I immediately contacted ground. The Ground Controller's first words were 'you just cut off that Cessna 172 to your left'. I looked up and there was a 172 fifty FT away entering the same intersection; headed south on the taxiway. I did not expect to see him there because I was busy clearing the runway.This was the same 172 I had followed in on the approach. He had made an earlier turn off and was south bound on Taxiway Bravo; headed also for the GA ramp.As you can see from a Google Earth photo; there is no way an aircraft can clear Runway 14 at Taxiway A without intruding into Taxiway Bravo.The Local Controller did not appear to communicate with the Ground Controller because there should have been some coordination as to who had the right of way at this intersection before we both got there at the same time.The aircraft I 'cut off' was the 172 that landed prior to me. They took an earlier turn-off and followed me to the GA ramp and shut down next to me. In the plane were two FAA examiners. As a result of this possible conflict I was ramp checked. (The process was very pleasant and took no more than a minute or two.) There was no mention of the intersection incident.I spoke to the FAA pilots/examiners in the FBO and apologized that I did not see them and was simply trying to get clear of Runway 14; and that the placement of the hold line caused me to taxi well into Taxiway Bravo. Fortunately they had seen me exiting the runway and stopped in time to avoid bending metal. I believe there was improper coordination between the Ground and Local Controllers. I was not told to hold short of Taxiway Bravo so my obligation was to fully clear the runway. Ground Control should have held southbound traffic into the ramp to allow landing aircraft to clear Runway 14. The confluence of Taxiways Alpha and Bravo at the intersection of Runway 14/32 and Runway 5/23 and the GA ramp is congested. The hold short lines are very close to active taxiways.

245,245,245,245,9526,While working the radar position on Sector 05; we were feeding Miami Approach all of the arrivals through one fix.  Every single airport in Miami Approach's airspace was being fed through the FAMIN ATA due to weather.  Aircraft X was level at 100 and Approach had the handoff with communication.  I had initially vectored Aircraft Y northbound due to the overtake he had on Aircraft X.  I waited till we had about 10 miles in between the aircraft and then proceeded to clear Aircraft Y inbound towards CURSO to cross CURSO at 100 and 210 knots.  I noticed that Aircraft Y was catching Aircraft X and I tried to stop him at 110 but he had already descended through 110.  I verified that he had reduced to 210 knots and proceeded to ship him to Approach.  At this time separation was less than 5 miles but approach was already talking to Aircraft X and I am uncertain of what type of rule they were using to separate the two aircraft.  My Supervisor told me that Approach might have been using a legal vector in order to maintain their separation standards. Everytime that there is weather over the SSCOT and JINGL arrivals; the procedure is to send all of the arrivals to the FAMIN ATA.  All of the aircraft have to cross the same fix at the same altitude and we pretty much have an air show every time trying to sequence 4 arrivals into 1.  Most of the time during the summer months; we not only get the arrivals from the north but we also get the arrivals from the east coast and then we have to try and sequence 6 arrivals in through 1 fix.  I always hear everybody complaining about this; but nothing has ever been done to remedy this situation.  Maybe we can incorporate a different procedure so that one controller doesn't have to be overloaded with this type of workload. There is more than enough space in approach to at least make another ATA for situations like these.  As far as the overtake with Aircraft Y and Aircraft X; if I wouldn't had been so busy trying to sequence all the arrivals; I would have shipped Aircraft Y as soon as they took the handoff and their would be no doubt in mind that approach was using some type of divergence rule to separate the aircraft.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
246,246,246,246,9736,I was providing OJT on the North Radar (NR) position when a SR22 came off and wanted to flight check a new RNP procedure to runway XX.  Runway XX was our departure runway at this time.  The procedure took place in South Radar (SR) so that sector worked him the majority of the time.  There was OJT also on SR at the time.  At this time; there was also OJT on Local Control with a high hour trainee who has struggled through the program.  The SR controller called tower and told them the intentions of the SR22; which was to fly a low approach and proceed on the missed approach procedure; which was basically runway heading.  The SR controller then transferred the SR22 to tower frequency when turning final.   When the SR22 was on about a 5 mile final; the SR OJTI asked if there was a heavy in position on runway XX; which I confirmed using our ASDE.  It was discussed that that wouldn't work with the SR22 flying a low approach.  We witnessed the SR22 fly over the approach end at approximately 500 ft while a B744 departed and was about a mile and a half in front of the SR22.  Tower called down to me and my trainee on NR stating 'The Cirrus doesn't want to fly the missed approach you gave him due to wake turbulence.'   We realized she just had a major deal and was thinking she was in recovery mode.  Upon further review; I was made aware that she thinks she was covered because she told the SR22 to maintain visual separation with the heavy B744 and caution for wake turbulence.  I'm only a TRACON controller; but it is my understanding that a low approach is considered a full length departure and they can't maintain visual separation and wave the wake turbulence on the heavy departure.  I asked a supervisor about the incident; and he looked it up and stated that there was no log of it.  I asked tower controllers about the incident and they said nothing was done during the event and it was not event brought up as a bad operation by the supervisor in charge up in the tower at the time. This tower trainee has struggled and taken much longer to get through the program than should be allowed; with multiple controllers and supervisors saying she should have been washed out many months ago.  Two days after this incident; her supervisor certified her on local.  This is a slap in the face to all the controllers who had to work hard and prove themselves competent to get certified.  For a trainee to have multiple deals and NMACs in a short amount of time and then get certified is a black mark on the FAA.  I recommend her certification ride be reviewed and for her to be disciplined for her loss of separation between a small and a heavy jet.  I also recommend her supervisor be disciplined for covering up a deal and to look into her certification standards.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

ZDC was late on getting aircraft down and switching to my position and was the initial reason our aircraft were being vectored abnormally high into our sector for sequence on the arrival. The complexity of the sector was increasing so I took over from the developmental; and gave an altitude of 9000 to a south bound ACR Y; when I meant to restate 8000; because of traffic opposite direction at 7000. ACR X was opposite direction to ACR Y as well and some 10 miles away. I thought I had lateral and vertical; but when I noticed the situation; I turned ACR Y right to a 270 heading. No response from ACR Y. I turned ACR X East to 090 with no response. I again did this to each aircraft with no response from either one. Finally after issuing a Traffic Alert to ACR X; who acknowledged turning East to 090. It was a case of meaning one thing and saying another.

248,248,248,248,1833,In Governor's Harbor [airport]; there is an over 8;000 foot strip. There is no taxiway; no tower; and a major hill in the middle of the runway where neither side can see the opposite end. When operating there; each pilot must trust that the others are making calls both to taxi out but also for landing. Aircraft there also repeatedly take off with a tail wind so it is difficult to know which side is being used at any time. In our case; we were departing off of Runway 15 and we made three radio calls; one to back taxi; one to position for takeoff; and one for takeoff. While cresting the hill on the takeoff roll we discovered that a multi engine piston aircraft was pointed right at us. We were past V1 and we continued to rotate and takeoff as the other aircraft did a 180 and attempted to head back to the ramp at the end of the runway. I do not know if they were taking off with a tailwind or taxing to 15 but they made no radio call and obviously were not listening to UNICOM. The FBO also made a call to the aircraft telling them that the runway was active and they needed to clear. Our crew followed every procedure to make this a safe takeoff; unfortunately we cannot prevent others from disregarding the rules of safe operations.This was a pretty close call; especially if the aircraft was trying to takeoff with a tailwind. If we had been 20 seconds later it could have been catastrophic. The fact that it is uncontrolled; has no taxiway; and you cannot see either side from either end makes this a very dangerous airport to operate in especially when the locals do not follow proper communication procedures. We as our crew did absolutely nothing wrong; we had no reason to believe that an aircraft would be reckless enough to not communicate and taxi without concern for themselves or anyone else; we made proper radio calls and did everything we could.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

At the same time we noticed traffic advisory on MFD. We were able to visually acquire the aircraft and shortly thereafter; a TCAS Descend RA was commanded. Auto pilot was already off and PIC immediately complied with RA. No limits were exceeded and approach was not destabilized. The other aircraft came very close to us on a direct; perpendicular flight path. Estimated distance was approximately 300 FT horizontal and 0 FT vertical. It appeared not to have used it's transponder before ATC notification/TCAS display of aircraft. As we quickly cleared other aircraft; we safely continued the approach and landing to Runway 19. We queried ATC as of status of the other aircraft. They advised us they were not in radio contact and that it was violating the airspace. They also told us they were tracking the aircraft on the radar. I advised them of RA compliance in the air and also that it was a low wing; small aircraft.

250,250,250,250,2472,We were departing a small Bahamian airport when a light twin landed suffering some sort of gear malfunction. The malfunction resulted in a belly landing for the aircraft; an Aerostar I believe. The aircraft came to rest in a position leaving approx. 4000 FT of runway unobstructed. At the time of the belly landing we had only started the #2 engine and were sitting on the FBO ramp having not moved from our initial parked position. Once we were aware of the problem aircraft I began to deplane so I could offer assistance to the disabled aircraft not knowing their status. The Captain stopped me and told me to sit down; that we needed to leave to keep our schedule. I objected and the Captain told me that he was keeping our schedule. He proceeded to taxi and I had to stop him from blocking the path for an emergency vehicle. After the fire truck passed several airport officials; two of whom were in uniform; crossed their arms over their heads and attempted to stop the taxi. I brought this to the Captains attention and he did respond. He proceeded to start the #1 engine on the taxi roll disregarding any checklist. Multiple aircraft on the approach to the airport reported they were diverting because of the fouled runway; the Captain spoke to one of them via the Unicom frequency.As the Captain entered the runway I brought it to his attention that we needed 3600 FT of runway according to the performance data for the airplane to safely takeoff and I questioned the wisdom of taking off on approx. 4000 FT of runway with a disabled aircraft with passengers and emergency crews were still close proximity. The Captain turned around with about 25kt clearance to the fire truck and over my objection he initiated a takeoff. At no point did the Captain respond to any of my objections.

252,252,252,252,10592,Local Controller departed Aircraft X from Runway 08. My positions: FD/CD (Flight Data/Clearance Delivery) combined with Ground Control and CIC (Controller-in-Charge). Seconds after; Aircraft Y called SJU Tower and transmitted 'Aircraft Y is SQUAWK [code] runway heading'. I attempted to Multifunction display squawk code; and did not find any FP (flight plan) in the ASR-8 system; and relayed to Local. It was obvious Aircraft Y had departed from Runway 09 at Isla Grande Airport -SIG; (adjacent airport about 6 miles west of SJU Tower); due to a visible primary target squawking [their code] in the departure end of SIG Runway 09 climbing out of 1;000. After XA:00L SIG Tower class D reverts to Class E; CTAF. Local Controller responded 'Aircraft Y do not fly runway heading; say intentions; I have a departure.' Aircraft Y responded 'we request radar vectors please.' By this time Aircraft X has already started takeoff roll. Local Controller asked Aircraft Y if he had SJU Tower in sight; and he replied yes. LC (Local Controller) then instructed Aircraft Y to fly direct SJU Tower and continue eastbound between the runways on a heading of 095. LC then asked Aircraft Y to verify call sign. Aircraft Y responded with his squawk code. Aircraft Y did not comply with any instruction and continued to fly eastbound still climbing. LC directed Aircraft Y 'proceed over head the control tower now.' Aircraft Y continued flying eastbound climbing out of 3;500 feet. Aircraft X was then instructed to maintain 3;000; and LC coordinated an altitude of VFR at or above 5;000 for Aircraft Y. Aircraft Y was given a brasher warning/possible pilot deviation and switched to San Juan Approach 119.4 frequency. Aircraft Y is clearly unfamiliar with SJU class C airspace; and additionally does not fully comprehend the English language to the extent necessary to responsibly fulfill his duties as a pilot in command. Additionally; Aircraft Y departed VFR; but checked in with a squawk code which also caused confusion on whether or not he was an IFR or VFR aircraft.My recommendation would be to validate the qualifications of Aircraft Y and assure the pilot is aware of airspace and regulations. In my opinion; any control instruction given to Aircraft Y would have been unsuccessful due to his lack of the English language and situational awareness.

255,255,255,255,3237,I was training with an instructor on Local Control. The event started with me verbally requesting the inactive Runway 17; to which Ground Control gave me permission to use. The memory aid was used to indicate the runway was now Local Control jurisdiction. After which I moved my focus to the training C172's that were in the active runway 8's downwind. I gave the C172 holding instruction to protect for a possible go around on the crossing runway. As Aircraft X became closer to Runway 17 and was committed to the landing I returned my focus to the C172's in the downwind for Runway 8. Instructed the C172's to roll out on the downwind to rejoin the pattern. During the roll out the second C172 holding east of the crossing runway rolled out before the first C172 west of the crossing runway. I decided to re-sequence and issued control instructions. One of the C172 misunderstood the instructions and began to converge with the other so my attention was out the window looking at the aircraft which put my back to Aircraft X which was in the short final area. I resolved the situation with the C172's and returned to my scan to find Aircraft X rolling out and Aircraft Y had finished it's crossing of Aircraft X's landing runway at taxiway D.I'm not sure of when Aircraft Y began its crossing or if Aircraft X noticed the incursion. Simultaneously as I noticed the incursion Aircraft X was committed to landing and the nose of the aircraft was dropping and it would have been unsafe to send the aircraft around. At their closest they appeared 2000 plus feet away. No pilot in command acknowledged the incursion or question any instructions. The Controller Instructor was focused with me on the actions happening opposite of the runway incursion. All memory aids and communication were used according to standards.

256,256,256,256,10222,After landing at PANC; directed to taxi via Taxiway R and TWY U. The weather was very dark with light rain and wet taxiways. As the aircraft approached TWY U; the Captain was focused on finding centerline of TWY U from TWY R. As the aircraft committed to the turn; the First Officer noticed a white Ford van enter TWY U crossing north to south on the access road parallel to TWY R. The First Officer alerted the Captain to the intrusion. He slammed on the brakes and was able to stop the aircraft. As the aircraft was stopping; the First Officer reached up to turn on all landing lights in an attempt to alert the van. After the van cleared to the south; the First Officer alerted Tower to the incident. As we were parking the aircraft; we were able to hear ANC Tower directing security to stop the subject van. This event was caused by an inattentive or negligent driver that failed to yield to an aircraft taxiing on dark; wet night. The drivers around the airport (this driver in particular) need to be reminded about the limited maneuverability of aircraft on the taxiways and the need to be conscientious about yielding to aircraft on taxiways. This is particularly important when heavy aircraft are attempting to taxi on dark; wet (slick) taxiways.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I saw that Toga had a departure that was level at 5;000 but would want to climb. I called Toga and said I'll stay at 8;000 or above with my aircraft. Toga approved this and steadied the point out.

The conflicting traffic was 12 O-Clock about 1/2 mile; passing right to left and diving rapidly through our altitude.  Simultaneously; the TCAS called 'Adjust Vertical Speed'.  As the Pilot Flying; I maintained a visual with the conflicting aircraft and evaded by executing a right turn (into the path of the conflicting aircraft); while continuing the climb; based on the conflicting traffic descending and passing to the left.  No unusual attitude or angle of bank was required in the evasion maneuver.  The evasion was mild enough to the point of there not being any questioning from flight attendants or passengers as to what had occurred.  No further incident and the flight continued uneventfully.

During our turn to base; the Tower called us; but when we replied; they said; 'Disregard.' We continued our circling approach in compliance with the AIM when we heard Tower transmit to another aircraft on 'short final' for Runway 35 as we were turning final. When our right (high) wing was up in the turn; we saw a much faster moving aircraft approaching on a straight-in final approach. At nearly the same time; the Tower told us to go-around; which we did; immediately. Tower then further instructed us to side-step left of centerline during our go-around and offered us to return for a low approach. Our training flight required a landing from a circling approach; so I asked the Tower for another lap in the traffic pattern to accomplish a touch-and-go. The Tower refused; stating; 'Unable touch-and-go. Climb to 2000 [feet] and contact Seattle Approach.' I could sense the anger and frustration in the voice of the controller. We departed the airspace with our training mission failed.The controller failed to properly sequence arriving traffic and allowed us to turn base-to-final in front of faster moving traffic flying a long final approach causing a near midair collision. The controller then became angry and denied us further services. Thus; we felt it safer to leave the airspace than to deal with a stressed controller who had already demonstrated an inability to handle the current volume of traffic at the airport.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
260,260,260,260,9027,Aircraft Y was climbed to FL210 above Aircraft X at FL200 and given direct SHV airport. Aircraft Y was then handed off to Sector 30 Monroe Low. Aircraft X was being handed off to my Sector (83) UIM Low from Sector 30. When Sector 30 took the hand off on the Aircraft Y; I then switched the aircraft to Sector 30 after ensuring there was no traffic call needed between the Aircraft Y and Aircraft X. Sector 30 has control for turns and lower on Shreveport landers which Aircraft Y was. Since Aircraft X was on our mutual sector boundaries when Sector 30 took the hand off on Aircraft Y; I did not reference Aircraft X to Sector 30 in relation to the AIT that Sector 30 has control for turns and lower on SHV landers. I continued to work additional traffic when I saw FL130 interim altitude put in Aircraft Y's data block. At that time Aircraft Y and Aircraft X were lateral and approximately 3 NM separated. I immediately called Sector 30 and asked if they were descending Aircraft Y. I believe he said he was and I asked about Aircraft X; during this call I had PVD'd Aircraft X back on Sector 30's scope. I don't believe he remembered Aircraft X. I hung up and was going to turn Aircraft X but there was such a huge speed difference and I knew the aircraft were both safe so I did not execute a turn. I don't believe we actually need this AIT; especially for descent. Where Sector 30 has control for turns and lower is still approximately 70 NM away from SHV Airport and well inside UIM Lows airspace. With the new 4th Line coordination we have in effect in ZFW there really is no need for this AIT. To prevent other incidents from occurring this should be looked at. Sector 30 having worked Aircraft X did have the 'known' traffic for the Aircraft Y however since this AIT occurs 15 NM inside of UIM Lows airspace there is a chance that the known traffic will be mistakenly overlooked. Also; there could be a change of controllers and this known traffic could easily be overlooked in the briefing. Sector 30 is a large sector and most controllers have their MDM's set right at the limits required and no further out which could facilitate missing the limited data block if the traffic is dropped; or if not dropped it's feasible that the data block could be under the limits of the MDM.

It was at this time we were informed that we nearly were pushed into Aircraft Y that had recently pushed off of the gate next to us. The tow crew moved us to a spot next to them and let us know we had not contacted another aircraft; ramp equipment; or any other objects. Also; at this time we were informed that they had pushed us back shorthanded. Upon learning this the Captain contacted operations at TYS where the ramp crew member on the other end was rude; standoffish; and non-apologetic about their mistake. In his words 'don't tell us how to do our job; it's not our fault; we are trying to get a mainline flight out.' While we were on the taxiway out to the runway ground control contacted us and told us Aircraft Y would like to speak to us.

263,263,263,263,9667,I was working when the sector that was working Aircraft Y called me to tell me that they had attempted to point out Aircraft Y to the adjacent ARTCC sector. The controller who was working Aircraft Y then told me that the transferring controller had refused to accept the point out because he said he was giving me traffic at the same altitude. The traffic that controller was referencing was Aircraft X. I believe that the controller who was working Aircraft Y attempted to point the aircraft out so that the adjacent ARTCC controller could perhaps descend Aircraft X below Aircraft Y since Aircraft X needed to start down anyway. The controller who was working Aircraft Y informed me of the situation at which time I called the adjacent ARTCC controller and told the controller to put Aircraft X on a 180 degree heading for the traffic.I don't believe that the control instruction that I issued was issued immediately as I did not notice the aircraft begin a turn for approximately 1 to 2 minutes. I believe that Aircraft X checked on my frequency while I was calling the adjacent ARTCC controller to have them attempt to contact the aircraft. When I came off the landline I issued a descent to Aircraft X for traffic. Approximately 20 seconds later Aircraft X said they were descending in response to an RA at which time I believe I called the traffic.

264,264,264,264,6935,We diverted into MCO due to weather at the planned destination. Based on ramp location and ATIS at MCO; the planned departure runway was Runway 36L. After start-up on Taxiway A; we encountered an ATC ground hold due to sequencing into [destination airport] for approximately 20 minutes. Subsequent taxi instructions; 'Taxi to Runway 36L via A; B10 hold short 36L.' After holding short for landing traffic on Runway 36L; we were unexpectedly cleared to cross Runway 36L and hold short of Runway 36R. We advised Tower we were expecting 36L but he instructed us to 36R for noise abatement. We frequently encounter runway changes (Runway 8L for Runway 8R) and have developed a good flow to quickly prepare the aircraft for departure. FO updated the FMC; confirmed takeoff data (level off and power setting); runway heading and briefed while taxiing to hold short of 36R. Prior to reaching the hold short; we were cleared to 'line up and wait 36R' but I requested a couple of minutes. Although we were both ready and aircraft was properly configured for departure; I directed the FO to pull out the QRH and review the new 'takeoff runway or performance change procedure.' We advised tower we needed a couple of minutes and was instructed to hold short of Runway 36R and I acknowledge the 'hold short.' Upon reaching the hold short line I set the parking brake and selected the Override light switch. The FO found the procedure and we ran through it confirming everything had been considered and properly accomplished. As we completed the procedure and looked outside; we and the tower simultaneously recognized we were moving. Tower instructed us to hold short; but the aircraft had crossed the hold short line by a few feet. Another aircraft on the other side of the runway (east side of B10) had received clearance for takeoff. Even though our aircraft didn't interfere with the other aircraft's path on to the runway; we had cross the 'Hold Short Line' and takeoff clearance was canceled and they had to exit the runway. We then were cleared for takeoff and departed uneventfully. I specifically recall setting the brake and turning on the override light in one motion just as we do when reaching a parking spot. I just couldn't account for how the parking brake released. However; when we arrived [at our destination]; while waiting for an outbound aircraft; I had an opportunity to set the parking brake several times on the taxiway. I discovered that with light differential pressure on the top of the rudder pedals; the parking brake would slowly release. The parking brake handle would slowly descent (release). Typically; setting and releasing the parking brake; requires a firm force and the handle snaps down with some aural feedback. I entered a discrepancy in the logbook for an inspection of the parking brake system. A couple more comments: one; fatigue may have some minor contribution after a long day. Two; provide more flexibility to the crews by changing the 'takeoff runway or performance change procedure' to a guide. This would not require a crew to review it; if the crew is familiar with the steps required to change runways. In our case; it directly contributed to the incursion because we had to stop; find the procedure and perform the steps while we were on the hold line.,"[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

An aircraft can be stopped with nose over the equipment road and there is no consideration by operators of the aircraft or conditions at the time. They simply run around the nose of the aircraft (without even slowing and it appears without a glance to one side of the other); certainly without looking at the aircraft or crew.

266,266,266,266,675,While tracking the localizer inbound from vectors for the ILS [Runway] 08 at BUR; ATC pointed out traffic at our 11 o'clock; maneuvering at 4;500 FT MSL. Both myself and the pilot not flying spotted two small single engine aircraft in this position converging on us and they also appeared on TCAS as blue targets. The pilot not flying reported 'in sight' to ATC. A few seconds later we received an RA from the closest target. Although the pilot not flying said; 'Got 'em;' to me; I no longer had this aircraft in sight as it had disappeared from my view underneath the left front side of our aircraft. I disconnected the autopilot and complied with the RA and requested the pilot not flying advise ATC of our action; which he did and they acknowledged. This resulted in a climb of approximately 300 FT at which time the 'monitor vertical speed' command was issued and I leveled off. A few seconds later 'clear of conflict' was issued and we advised ATC and returned to 5;000 FT MSL and re-engaged the autopilot. We were then cleared for the ILS approach. The remainder of the approach and landing were completed normally without unusual events. As a note; while descending on the glideslope over VNY; we received a TCAS TA. We spotted traffic that appeared to be in the pattern at VNY. This is a very common occurrence while on this approach in VMC. Probable cause may have been the other aircraft starting to climb and/or possible detected closure rate by the TCAS. I believe this is a VFR practice area and is also a common arrival route and altitude range for IFR and VFR traffic into the area airports. Possibly extending the BUR class C airspace further west and at a higher altitude and keeping controlled aircraft inside this airspace would help prevent these occurrences.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Aircraft X was climbing up also just east of the Aircraft Y and said she was deviating to MBW...Aircraft X's Data Block stated DR/MBW in the fourth line; which means deviating right; MBW when able.  So Aircraft X turned direct to MBW heading right for Aircraft Y.  I immediately turned the Aircraft X to a H360 and expedite their climb through 22;000 FT with clearance up to 32;000 FT.

The Controller informed us of parachute operations in effect at the UUU airport. The non flying pilot happened to have the WAC chart book out following our progress up the coast as it was a nice VFR day. He noticed we were headed for the Newport State airport. So we asked the Controller about the progress of the jump operations. ATC then gave us a turn to 060. After completing the turn; and less than a minute later; ATC came back and said jump operations were several minutes earlier and probably concluded. Then another Controller came on the frequency and said cleared direct to BONDI (one of the fixes on the approach). So we turned back to 090; heading to BONDI. Just a few seconds after the turn; the SIC yelled; and I instantly looked where he was looking; and saw a tandem chute with two people in black suits; looking at us; at 12 o'clock and about 1;000-1;500 FT and slightly above our altitude. I quickly disconnected the autopilot and banked hard left missing the jumpers. We informed ATC about our surprise on the vector and all he said was that we were cleared direct to the airport.

275,275,275,275,9104,I was holding short of Runway 29R on Taxiway B2 at Stockton (SCK) in preparation for a VFR departure en route to ZZZ; waiting for a [Company] heavy aircraft to land and clear the runway. The prevailing conditions were night VFR; with unlimited visibility; clear skies; and minimal wind. Stockton Tower was closed; and traffic was coordinating via CTAF. After the heavy aircraft landed and cleared; I made my CTAF call indicating that I was taking Runway 29R for departure. The heavy aircraft crew acknowledged my transmission and noted that they were clear of all runways. While beginning my takeoff roll; a ground vehicle; self-identified as a tug; made a radio call on CTAF that they were crossing Runways 29L/29R en route to the cargo ramp. This was the first call the tug made on CTAF. I made another radio call noting that I was in my takeoff roll; and began visually searching for the tug. I reduced engine power to idle; and applied heavy braking. At that time I saw the tug's anti-collision lights cross in front of my aircraft. I stopped on the runway and made an additional radio call noting that I was aborting takeoff and returning to RWY (Runway) 29R. At no point did the tug acknowledge any of these radio calls or change behavior. I returned to RWY 29R and made an otherwise uneventful departure.Primary cause of the problem: runway incursion by airport tug vehicle that was broadcasting on; but possibly not monitoring; the CTAF frequency.Proximate causes of the problem: airport ops vehicles likely unused to operating on CTAF after-hours at normally tower-controlled airport. Night conditions may have made it difficult for the ops vehicle to see my aircraft on the runway; and made it more difficult for me to see the ops vehicle. Complacency: SCK is a cargo airport; and extremely quiet at night. It's possible that the ops vehicle crew was accustomed to only seeing large cargo aircraft operating at SCK at night; and so my comparatively smaller (and unscheduled) aircraft may have not been noticed/ignored. Finally; the airport operations staff may not have been aware that entering a runway - even several thousand feet down the runway from a takeoff aircraft - is still prohibited.Preventative measures: training for airport ops crews on proper radio use; importance of clearing runways prior to crossing; and runway incursion avoidance best-practices.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

After handing off and vectoring the go around I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff and put Aircraft Z in position; as Aircraft A was now on final.  Aircraft Y asked to verify his takeoff clearance which was done.  Aircraft Z was cleared and Aircraft A put into position with Aircraft B on a 4 mile final.  I cleared Aircraft A for takeoff anticipating Aircraft Z will be 6;000 feet and airborne by the time Aircraft A starts to roll.  Aircraft B stated he needed to go missed because he's too high.  I elected to cancel the takeoff clearance for Aircraft A shortly after they started to roll as I was concerned he may become an issue with Aircraft B.  Aircraft A then taxied back to the end and took off.  The Front Line Manager (FLM) said I was clean; and nice job.If I had put Aircraft Y in position right after the go around of Aircraft X things wouldn't have ended up so tight.  As I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff I may have caused some confusion as I put Aircraft Z into position right behind him causing Aircraft Y to confirm he was cleared for takeoff; slowing their departure.  Additionally we were just about to go into a runway use plan which calls for the runway I was working to be departure only.  The tower FLM wanted the program to start earlier and traffic management in the TRACON didn't want to.  I think the TRACON was trying to hurry Aircraft X and Aircraft B in before the program started which resulted in unstabilized approaches and back to back pilot initiated go arounds.

As per the facility SOP; we are not to clear the Seattle arrival traffic with an aircraft inbound to Boeing Field (BFI) until that aircraft is descended past 1800 on the localizer. A bizjet was being worked by the Boeing Final Controller (D Sector) I saw the bizjet nine miles out; inbound and decided that it was no factor. I cleared my Caravan on the ILS to 16R just past BUGNE. I kept an eye on the bizjet descending and saw no conflict. The Approach Monitor and the Boeing Final Controller mentioned nothing regarding the traffic and the Caravan was shipped at the FAF as per the rules of the facility. I was informed two weeks later that the two aircraft had lost separation and observed the RADAR data. It appears that the bizjet had seen/had traffic called for a target at approximately 800 FT MSL in front of them. The bizjet climbed from 1;100 to 1;200-1;300 and then descended again. The Caravan was at 2;100-2;200 on the final approximately 2.9 miles away with unknown divergence. No traffic was called for the Caravan. Both landed. Recommendation; in a perfect control environment there would be no waiver procedures that try to make up separation where there is none. S46/BFI/SEA' 'Plan Alpha' is an attempt at such separation. This was an example of how two airports less than 3 miles apart with crossing arrivals can have problems. In the future to prevent this type of separation loss I should have followed the facilities rules of not clearing the Caravan until the bizjet was out of 1;800 FT; descending. While that is not why I lost separation it would have caused me to be too high above the glide-slope with the Caravan; and as a result; I would have had to cancel the approach clearance and climb the Caravan; therefore taking the aircraft out of the problem.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
280,280,280,280,2772,Ramp Control did a very poor job in traffic control on the ramp in rainy; windy; and night conditions. When pushing back from the gate; Ramp Control requested that we 'push deep to allow the aircraft to push back also.' Unbeknownst to us an aircraft was approaching us from our rear to taxi into a nearby gate. Ramp Control never said a word about the aircraft approaching us from behind. During our push back; I urged the tug driver to 'push deep;' so that the nearby aircraft could continue his push back. The tug driver was reluctant to keep pushing the aircraft and he slowed down his push and then stated 'what the heck is going on here; and where is that aircraft behind us going.' The tug driver then stopped the push and the aircraft behind us departed the ramp taxi line and somehow was able to get behind our aircraft at an abnormal angle and enter the gate. When I saw that the taxiing aircraft was going to attempt this maneuver; I asked the tug driver to watch that aircraft's wingtip and our tail. It was minimum clearance and appeared to be just a few feet of clearance to me. The tug driver was surprised as well. During this entire incident; Ramp Control had no instructions for any of the 3 aircraft involved. When I then inquired to Ramp Control why they didn't tell us about the incoming aircraft they stated 'incoming aircraft are on their own.' Exactly why is it we have Ramp Control at all; if 'aircraft taxiing in are on their own;' as Ramp Control informed me? What exactly are they 'controlling?'  Certainly not my aircraft; and certainly not the incoming aircraft in this case. And but for the alertness of a worker who was in the tug; it almost resulted in a ground strike.  Ramp Control was not [effectively] in charge of traffic in the alley.  Ramp Control should have told the aircraft pushing back; what was going on; and should never have allowed the inbound aircraft to continue when Ramp Control could easily see that a problem was developing.  I commented to the Ramp Controller that I didn't like what just occurred and I would like to request that henceforth we be notified of conflicting traffic even if it approaches us from behind.  Suggestions: any aircraft that is pushing back needs to be informed if he is conflicting with an inbound aircraft; and blocking that aircraft's gate. If no notice is given to the aircraft pushing back; then Ramp Control needs to be very 'hands on' and actively control outbound and inbound aircraft; especially at night and especially in the rain.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I don't remember their exact response as everything happened quickly; but they did respond something about a military aircraft. We continued to climb and the TCAS TA turned into an RA that prompted us to 'monitor vertical speed' in a climb; which we were already doing. I got the traffic in sight as it approached us.

282,282,282,282,533,I don't recall the aircraft call signs or the exact time. I was working radar on the POE/AEX sector combined. I had track control of AIRCRAFT 1; a VFR aircraft. The aircraft was in POE approach airspace; heading northbound; in a very slow climb. Something on the order of 100-200 feet per minute. The aircraft flight plan showed the aircraft was climbing to 11;500. I didn't believe this aircraft would ever hit my airspace; so I handed the data block off to MLU approach. They took the handoff and I 'slant zeroed' the data block.Sometime later; I noticed the aircraft on the POE/MLU boundary in conflict alert with AIRCRAFT 2; southbound; level at 10;000. I made a mention to my D-side that they were going to be close. Shortly after the two aircraft passed each other; I received a radio call from the pilot of AIRCRAFT 1 telling me that an aircraft had just flown past him. Less than 1/8 of a mile. I had no idea that AIRCRAFT 1 was on my frequency. I mistakenly believed that POE had switched the aircraft to MLU approach. This was my mistake. The previous controller had; in fact; told me that AIRCRAFT 1 was on my frequency. I don't know how I missed this in the briefing. I assume it was because I was looking at other situations on the scope and not listening closely enough to what the previous controller was actually saying.This incident was caused by my own failure to properly listen to the relief briefing.

284,284,284,284,7434,I was flying VFR above a broken/scattered layer with tops at about 9;500 feet after having climbed above the layer. Though I get flight following on 95% of my flights; traffic was so light (due to the pandemic); that I chose not to speak with ATC this day. I knew I had to fly well south of my destination before I could descend in relatively clear conditions. As I was descending and turning to the NW; I was suddenly staring directly at a commercial jet crossing my path from right to left 3+ miles directly ahead and below less than one thousand feet. I initiated a hard turn to the right and shallow climb; and I noticed the jet banking to its right. I was surprised to see a jet in this location at this altitude; so far west of ZZZ. I fly this route often for training; but rarely above 6;000 feet; so later after landing I studied the ZZZ STARS and saw that this jet was right where it was supposed to be on the STAR. I had collected the weather soon after the traffic encounter and it was reporting 5;500 broken which equates to an MSL ceiling of 7;000; which is about where the jet was. I realize now; that the jet was descending through the cloud layer that I flew around and the jet speed was such that it must have emerged from the cloud layer during my momentary 'heads down' to get the frequencies at my destination. The encounter was rattling; and I can imagine the pilots of the jet making a colorful comment or two about general aviators. There are many obvious lessons here. Talk to ATC; maintain a traffic scan and pay closer attention to any traffic information available on the MFD. Nevertheless; I realize now that I do not have a full understanding of the STARs in my area since they are generally used by turbojet aircraft capable of 250 knots and arriving from the flight levels. In particular; I note that there are 25 STARs published for the airports under the Class B airspace. I believe it would be helpful for all general aviation pilots in this crowded airspace if there was a chart showing all the routes that was color coded for altitude. A chart with high glance value would be worth checking when traversing the region VFR. Better yet; would be a layer on Fore Flight or other EFB showing all STAR routes with a selectable altitude; say; between 6;000 to 7;000; or between 7;000 and 9;000; etc.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

286,286,286,286,7658,We landed Runway 27 at BOS and turned off on Taxiway K and we were switched to Ground. Ground cleared us to cross Runway 4L on Taxiway K. Ground then cleared us to proceed on Taxiway K and turn right on Taxiway A. Approaching Taxiway B; I noticed an aircraft on Taxiway K pointed at us (opposite direction) on Taxiway K just west of Taxiway A and north of the main AARF. His taxi light was on. The Captain stopped our 757 with the nose just past the east edge of Taxiway B and set the parking brake. The other aircraft either began taxiing or continued taxiing toward us as if he didn't see us. As this aircraft approached Taxiway B; he began a left turn onto Taxiway B still taxiing as if he did not see us. The Captain turned on all our taxi and landing lights and shouted 'Stop; stop; stop; stop; stop!' on Ground Control frequency. At this point I recognized the aircraft as another air carrier's MD-80 series aircraft. As he continued his left turn; I thought his right wingtip was going to hit our cockpit. The MD-80 pilot steered left of the taxiway centerline and I observed his left main gear on the very left edge of the taxiway. (I later thought the gear was going to hit one of the blue taxiway lights). The MD-80 right wingtip passed an estimated 10 FT in front of our nose. The other pilot never acknowledged our calls and never slowed his aircraft.

287,287,287,287,9010,I was flying VFR to Orlando Executive Airport (ORL). I had just departed from that same airport and was taking a joyride with my wife. She began to feel ill so I cut our flight short and was returning to land. I was monitoring the Tower frequency so that I would have an understanding of the air traffic situation upon my arrival in the area. I collected ATIS on Comm 2 and noticed it was the same information as my departure. I called Tower at 15 miles out and was told to continue inbound and make a turn for left base. As this was my first flight into ORL visually; I had some brief trouble locating the airport; but located it when I was about 7 or 8 miles out and to the northwest. When I was about 4 1/2 miles from the airport; I began a right turn to join the base leg. Just prior to starting my turn; I heard Tower talking to another aircraft in the pattern. ATC then contacted me; as I had just started my turn; and told me I would be number 2 for landing; to keep an eye out for the traffic that was crosswind and to go ahead and turn south and fly west of downtown to join base. I read back the instructions as I attempted to locate the other aircraft. At the time of the call I was already north/northeast of downtown and turning south to join base and did not really consider that my course would take me on the east side of downtown. I quickly made the traffic now flying downwind and determined that I would be able to follow it in while maintaining safe separation. Tower contacted me and informed me that a jet would be departing before my landing; and I acknowledged. Tower then said it looked like I was out of position and issued a traffic alert for the aircraft I was observing on the downwind. As I was receiving this alert; the other aircraft turned right directly on my line of flight and at my 12 o'clock; now heading straight for me. I estimated its altitude to be a couple hundred feet above mine as I was descending for the turn to final. I pushed the nose forward and passed under the other aircraft at 250-300 feet. As I did this; I informed the Tower that I still had the traffic and believed I was in the correct position heading south on a left base. Tower then informed me that I was on the wrong side of downtown [and] that they had directed me to the west side and I was on the east. I apologized and was cleared to land.Upon reflection; I remember receiving and reading back the Tower direction to fly base on the west side of downtown; however; I was already east of downtown and to fly the directed base turn; I would have had to backtrack somewhat and fly a west/southwest course instead of the south course I was directed. As the rest of Tower instructions matched what I was expecting and indeed already doing; and as I was focused on looking for the traffic I had been made aware of; I automatically assumed I was on the correct side of downtown without stopping to verify. There seems to be three contributing factors to the incident. First; I failed to digest the entirety of the direction I'd been given resulting in my being out of position. Second; there was the confusing directive from the tower controller telling me to fly south and to fly west of downtown; when a south bound course would take me east of downtown. Finally; there was the unexpected right turn made by the other aircraft into my line of flight. Had they turned base; I would have been no factor in their flight and would have been able to safely follow them in. Instead; they performed a 360 [degrees] maneuver that took our two planes into close proximity and resulted in them following me in.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
288,288,288,288,5101,It was a complex weather day with light staffing. I was working at the Sector X with no D-side when TPA went into holding due to weather over the field and a cell west of the holding fix. The supervisor knew that the aircraft would be holding close to the weather for at least 30 minutes and told other sectors to keep them coming. The first holding aircraft was able to enter hold and stay clear of the weather. The supervisor decided to combine Sector Y to Sector X due to short staffing and allow for people to go on break. After the combining of the sectors approach started releasing aircraft to the west and aircraft from Sector Z started deviating into Sector Y which increased work load. I was given the D-side that was over at Sector Y after the sectors were combined and was also having to let the D-side know what was going on at Sector X. Two aircraft diverted to alternate airports while multiple aircraft were asking for left turns instead of right and different leg lengths to stay clear of the weather. At the same time an overflight came from a route directly towards the holding stack while departures from Miami center were released climbing towards the holding stack. The aircraft in hold ranged from 130 up to 230 with a gap at 180 and 210. The D-side was asking what altitude I wanted the overflight at when two departures from Miami had been cleared climbing to FL200 headed towards the holding stack northbound. I thought the D-side was asking about the departures and I replied FL210 which was one of the only altitudes available. Sector V stopped their overflight at FL210 and when I noticed the SRQ departure still climbing I turned the aircraft to the right trying to avoid the holding stack while also trying to avoid turning the aircraft directly into the weather and keep the aircraft climbing to get above all the traffic. At this time the supervisor noticed how complex it was and asked for a tracker to plug in. There was no airspace active out to the west and there were no aircraft rerouted to avoid the cluster north of the PIE VOR. Once the supervisor tried to split Sector Y back off the RA was in the process and I advised the holding aircraft that I had turned to the right that the other aircraft was turning away behind and climbing and was no factor. At the time of the RA; I had been on position for about an hour and a half with no D-side for over an hour with complex weather and traffic. The supervisor noticed there was only one person on break and need to combine something to keep employees from going over 2 hours on position and even after I told the supervisor it was not the best time to combine the sectors; it was combined up anyways.If SRQ departures were routed to the west during holding there would have not been such a small gap for all the aircraft to fly through and no loss of separation would have happened. TMU did nothing to start slowing the aircraft back and the supervisor told them to keep the aircraft coming. It was a situation with all the aircraft in one place place and not enough space and available altitudes when all the military airspace to the west was cold and should have been utilized. I felt that no coordination was done to prevent this incident and it was set up for failure.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
289,289,289,289,8585,We were on a left downwind for Runway 2R and were informed by the Tower that an aircraft was on right base for 2L. We didn't see the aircraft and asked Tower if we should start our base turn for 2R. Tower replied for us to start the base turn. On short final we noticed on the TCAS that it appeared that we were extremely close to the landing traffic on 2L. The Captain told me to go around and a second later we received an RA to climb. We complied with the RA and entered right downwind and landed. We queried the Tower about the landing traffic on 2L that gave us an RA; and she replied that she never told us to turn our base leg. The Captain replied 'yes you did.' The Tower answered back the other aircraft had us in sight. I find that hard to believe because when we received the RA; we were 100 to 200 FT above the other aircraft. Aircraft landing on the left side use left traffic pattern.

291,291,291,291,7065,I was in control of Flight X en route via an RNAV arrival. I issued Flight X direct [fix] to cross at 6;000 feet. Approximately 1 minute later; I observed a Mode C intruder target that had climbed VFR eastbound to 7;500 feet. I asked Flight X to increase the rate of descent due to VFR traffic eastbound at 7;500 feet. Uncomfortable with the descent; I issued Flight X twenty degrees left to descend below the target. I called the traffic again to Flight X and he reported the aircraft in sight. I asked if the altitude looked correct and Flight X responded with yeah and then 'about a thousand feet above.' At that moment I observed the intruder target descending and asked Flight X if he saw the same thing to which he responded yes. I asked if he wanted a turn and then just issued a 110 heading to avoid and allow Flight X to pull away. I then got lower from Approach to issue an altitude of 5;000 feet to which Flight X said he was getting an RA and descending. The target continued to descend into Flight X and uncomfortable with that; I called Approach again for lower and then issued 3;000 feet to Flight X. I advised Flight X to proceed direct to a fix when he was clear of the traffic.In hindsight; I am not sure what we are authorized to do once an aircraft is responding to an RA while at the same time you are getting lower with another facility. Once I issued 3;000 feet; I was in danger of being below our MIA's (Minimum IFR Altitude) and not having knowledge of Approach's Minimum Vectoring Altitudes. It is my opinion; and I believe our guidance; to allow the aircraft to finish the RA before taking any control action. Outside of a complete 360 turn; I was unsure of what to issue once Flight X was in the midst of an RA while an aircraft seemingly was descending right at another aircraft.I think there needs to be guidance on how to handle RA's with intruder targets so as not to leave anything to doubt. TCAS is very valuable but it creates doubt in our minds when we have to sit and watch while it handles the situation. Maybe some pilot interaction as to what they expect from us and do they know what our guidance is when we hear 'we're responding to an RA?',"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I issued the correct ATIS; told him which approach to expect; and since he was only requesting one approach issued his abnormal missed instructions. Those instructions were runway heading; maintain 3000. At this time my sector became saturated with inbounds to ZZZ; it was abnormally busy because the airport was ground stopped earlier in the day due to hard IMC conditions. After clearing Aircraft X for the approach; another controller helped by coordinating the missed instructions to the tower. About this time we were notified of a priority handling inbound to ZZZ; requesting to land runway XY; I started breaking air carriers out of my sequence; notifying them of the priority handling and Aircraft X would be the last approach to RWY XX before Aircraft Y.

293,293,293,293,6654,[ATC] was very busy with the rush of jet traffic; departing on Runway XX; arriving on YY. I complied with 'hold over the city' ATC instructions for approximately 10 minutes at reduced power setting; during which time I heard Tower give the wind to landing jet traffic. I had requested landing on XX as the Cessna 305A is a tail dragger and the reported winds of 340 at 6 were marginally over my personal cut-off of 5 knots. Hearing that the wind had lessened to 5 knots and knowing I would ease the Controller's traffic issue I informed him that I could accept landing on YY. He cleared me for a downwind and told me to expedite a base leg; something to the effect of 'keep it in close'. He was very busy; with a jet on a one mile final; another on a seven mile final; and five or six jets lined up to depart. He cleared me to land; number 2 to the landing traffic; I acknowledged the landing clearance. I turned base abeam the numbers and deployed full flaps; calculating my touchdown point beyond the landing jet's touchdown point to avoid wake turbulence; to which I had previously informed the tower I 'waived a wait time'.After rolling out on final; and below about a hundred feet AGL; I thought I heard the busy controller tell the landing jet to expedite his exit from the runway; and then inform me to 'go around'. I asked for him to say again; and looked to see if the previously landing jet was still occupying the runway. He had passed into the shadows at the far end; the uphill end; of the runway. I could not see him. I advanced the throttle only to find a cough and stutter. By this time my tail wheel was dragging on the runway. I continued to try to add power; but when my main wheels touched; facing an uphill takeoff; with a tailwind and a stuttering engine; into rising terrain I chose to abort the takeoff. I exited the runway without incident.I believe I turned base too close to the landing jet; allowed the mix of aircraft speeds to cause me to hurry; and the extended hold caused me to form carburetor ice. I did not have carb heat on after receiving my clearance to land; although I had used in previously upon my descent into the holding altitude. Despite the controller's obvious workload; and my attempt to minimize it; I should have availed myself of his perspective and asked him to call my base leg.

295,295,295,295,8257,I was approaching the Airventure event in Oshkosh; WI via the Fisk Arrival; as published in the Airventure NOTAM. Fisk arrivals were in use only for 1800 MSL and 90 knots with one mile spacing between aircraft. The 2300MSL/135 knot arrival was closed due to low ceilings. Runway 27 was in use for all the planes on the Fisk arrival because of a mass arrival happening on other runways. The distance from Ripon to Fisk is approximately 15NM and Fisk to near Gravel Pit (downwind entry to 27) is 8 NM. Winds at OSH were 010 at 9; gusting to 17. Upon arriving at Ripon and entering the train of arriving OSH; I had to break off early and make a 360 because another aircraft cut in ahead of me and I didn't want to be closer than requested spacing. Having reentered the route from Ripon to Fisk; I found the gap between my airplane and the airplane ahead of me shrinking several times. In order to maintain the gap between me and the slower aircraft; I had to reduce power and increase pitch attitude to keep the gap open; often operating at airspeeds where there is significant loss of effectiveness of aileron and rudder. Past Fisk; both the airplane in front of me and my plane directed up the railroad tracks for a landing at 27. Typically; aircraft are split off at Fisk to different runways and that helps with aircraft being stacked up too close closer to landing. The closeness to the aircraft ahead of me continued on the downwind to 27. I was planning for a right crosswind landing with a small quartering tailwind component. It was a tight 180 and I rolled out lined up on 27; being told to keep it in air and I added power and extended in order to stay airborne and land on green dot. The plane before me was landing on the orange dot and seemed to be on the runway for longer than expected because he was turning off on hard surface taxiway. Close to the runway; my descent rate was higher than I usually fly; and I added power while still correcting for the crosswind. The plane touched down; harder than normal; near but before the green dot and immediately the landing gear collapsed; and I slid down the runway a few hundred feet before sliding off into the muddy field to left of runway. I believe that not having the faster; high level approach to OSH available at that time; the variable speed between the aircraft in front of me and mine resulting in the shrinking and expanding gaps; made the approach more challenging. I have flown many kinds of challenging approaches in the past and felt like this was a safe and manageable approach to continue on as opposed to breaking off and landing at another airport. The resulting damage is limited to landing gear and propeller - and maybe a bit of my pride.,"[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
296,296,296,296,4310,Once climbing through 10;000 feet I accomplished my flow of turning off the applicable lights and moved the sterile switch to the off position. At that time I informed the First Officer (FO) who was pilot flying that I was going to go off com 1 to communicate to the FA's that we were going to be possibly heading into turbulence for an unforeseeable amount of time. If I remember correctly ATC had notified us earlier that we were in an area of possible moderate precipitation. Once the FO confirmed he had com 1 I immediate called the Flight Attendants (FA) on the PA/Call function to inform them that I felt it would be unsafe for them to get up and begin a service based on current conditions (rain; beginning of light turbulence). After we were briefly discussing the details on how notification to begin service would begin I immediately switched back to Com 1.Upon returning on frequency I remember hearing the altitude alerter going off and I notice the FO was in a descent to 11000 from an altitude that I can't specifically remember as I also noticed an amber TCAS message and if I remember correctly he was also communicating with ATC all at about the same time. I inquired about what has happen since my absence (30 seconds max). He explained that we slightly went above our assigned altitude and that we had gotten a vector from ATC because of our proximity to another Aircraft. I inquired ATC about the incident and asked if we needed a number to talk about the situation. After she communicated with what I assume was a supervisor she told us that due to an alert on her end we did. We eventually received a number to call and continued the remainder of the flight without incident.As stated above I had not noticed until returning to com 1 which by then the event had already occurred.I am honestly unsure. Communating with the Flight Attendant about the change from normal operation due to a safety concerned diverted my attention just long enough from the initiation of a level off at 11;000 feet that I have no recollection of the precise causes of the event.I do believe the weather played a factor as conditions were well beyond a standard day being that it was night; IMC; icing; precipitation and turbulent.I was trying to catch up to current events.I could have possibly waited until a positive level off at 11;000 feet. But at the same time I still felt that the Saftey and Communication with my crew was also a top priority at the time. Minus the weather a level off was the last was only clearance we had left to accomplish at the time.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

298,298,298,298,1323,I as the Local Controller departed aircraft X to the north off of Runway 32L. He was slightly unfamiliar with the 32 Runways; but I recognized the call sign as a fairly frequent flyer at CCR. I gave him instructions to depart; and later he called back inbound from the north with negative ATIS. I gave aircraft X the current altimeter and surface winds at CCR. He proceeded inbound with the instruction to enter a 2 mile right traffic entry for Runway 32R; and told to report a 2 mile 45.I saw aircraft X inbound 3 miles north of the field and cleared him to land number 3 to follow aircraft Z who was midfield right downwind. As aircraft X continued inbound; he entered more of a base entry when I saw him out the window again approximately a mile northeast of the field. Then aircraft X turned right downwind. Aircraft X never reported aircraft Z in sight so I updated aircraft X on the traffic to follow; which was now on short final. Aircraft X responded with 'in sight.' 3 minutes later aircraft X asked; 'Am I on the right track for the runway?' I had lost sight of aircraft X somewhere after turning base to final about a mile and a half south east of the field due to the sun and slight haze in the east area where he was. I informed him stating 'Not in sight; and the 32s point northwest bound; are you headed northwest bound?' Aircraft X immediately after I said that; then said: 'turning final now.'At this point; I also had aircraft Y on about a 1 mile final for Runway 32L who did report on final. I cleared aircraft Y to land on Runway 32L. I again cleared aircraft X to land on Runway 32R. I still did not see aircraft X; and asked him to say his altitude. He responded and I did not understand what he said. I asked him to clarify if he said 1;600 feet AGL or 300 feet AGL. Aircraft X then spoke up saying; 'I'm landing on 1L.' I immediately issued a go around to aircraft X because of 3 reasons. First I did not have control of Runway 1L as it was ground controls; second because vehicles were maneuvering on the runway and a mower was just east of the runway edge; and 3rd because aircraft Y was on very short final now for the active Runway 32L.There was no response from aircraft X. Approximately 2 seconds later; I keyed up again to say go around; but only stuttered 'go' before I noticed aircraft X was not going to comply and was just going to land on the inactive Runway 1L. I quickly issued a go around to aircraft Y; who did comply with the instruction. As aircraft X was rolling out; I asked how he heard my radio. He responded with 'loud and clear' and then proceeded to say 'I really messed up there; I'm sorry.'There wasn't any time to get control of runway 1L; even though I did attempt to get control of the runway; but Ground Control could not give me the runway because of the vehicles approved on the runway. I would recommend keeping a better eye on traffic that may be unfamiliar with our airport; even when they may seem like a frequent flyer. Because there is always training going on. I thought I did a good job asking if aircraft X was going northwest bound to be on final for the 32s; but I could clarify better on that. I also could have paid slightly more attention to the inactive runway with vehicles on it. The go around could have been issued earlier when I did not have him in sight; but expected him to be about a 1/2 mile.

304,304,304,304,93,Numerous little distractions kept us from noticing that the fuel was out of balance until after takeoff.  Distractions included being a day late due to a mechanical; 35-minute late van; aircraft not being at the gate when we arrived; aircraft not cleaned or catered; aircraft repair not complete due to contract-maintenance error; late fuel slip; late final weights; communication with load planning about need to move passengers for balance; inop VNAV; NADP1 departure; ACARS2 and Sabre learning curve.  Additional factors include the fact that because we dispatched with fuel on board (from our cancelled flight the night before) a fueler never had the chance to fix the imbalance.  Finally; we suspect the yellow IMBAL annunciation did not catch our attention because we are so used to seeing the yellow CONFIG annunciation on takeoff.  Also; we have gotten used to just looking at the total fuel indication; and we forget to check the individual tanks for balance.  We assume the imbalance was created by extensive APU use by the tow crew the day prior.  Enough fuel was burned to indicate that the APU was running for many hours.

305,305,305,305,588,I was monitoring my trainee during a typical training session. My trainee had made several control instructions and decisions that I thought required further discussion during the debrief. In the process of annotating the items I wanted to discuss I had not given my attention to the fact that he had vectored an aircraft towards an obstruction without ensuring the vertical/horizontal separation requirement to achieve separation from the obstruction. I looked up at the scope and noticed that the aircraft was below the MVA and in proximity of the obstruction about 2 seconds before the pilot notified us that he was close to the obstruction. Appropriate action was taken to achieve separation and I immediately notified the Supervisor of the incident. In previous evaluations of prior training sessions I have told the trainee to always ensure the separation from that particular obstruction by vectoring the aircraft southeast of it in the event that he may forget to climb the aircraft. I had also previously instructed him to always initiate a hand off as soon as possible to the next sector since (a) the receiving sectors boundary is close and an early flash will avoid a late hand off; and (b); an extra set of eyes on the aircraft can possibly alert him to climb the aircraft in time to avoid a separation error from the obstruction should he forget. In hindsight; I selected the wrong time to divert my attention from monitoring the RADAR scope as I gave my trainee too much credit for adhering to previously discussed problem areas. I trusted him to turn and climb and take full responsibility for the completely avoidable incident. Future training sessions will be approached with zero notes taking during any periods of traffic and I can guarantee that such a mistake and error in my judgment will never occur again. Recommendation; as mentioned on the previous page; I recommend and will follow my own advice; to never divert my attention with note taking during any periods of training that have active traffic. There are STARS tools in place that give me the capacity to review any training session as they occurred with audio and video. Should I not simply remember anything that I believe requires further discussion during a training session then I will take advantage of those tools rather than divert my attention to on position note taking. I will continue to trust; but verify; and never assume; that my student will comply with previously instructed corrections and procedures designed to avoid any incident that may result in any loss of separation.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

308,308,308,308,6078,From the moment we took off we encountered moderate turbulence and extreme rain showers. On the climb thru FL180 we remained in moderate turbulence; rain and begin picking up strong electrical fields around the cockpit or often referred to as St. Elmo's fire. This phenomenon continued through the flight until out of the weather. At approximately FL300 the left pack light came on. ATC had cleared us to FL400 but I requested to stop climb at FL320 to deal with pack issue. Shortly after the right pack light came on as well. I asked the FO to get out QRH and I took flying duties. He went to QRH for pack light on and I had my iPad out to follow along. He ran QRH and both packs reset. The cabin altitude was below 10000. At this point I turned the flying back to FO and informed ATC we would like to stay at FL320 inquired to ATC what was minimum safe altitude and we may have a problem and sent a call me message to dispatch. Very shortly after both packs came on again simultaneously. I requested lower immediately and received first of several descent altitudes. The FO decided to disengage the auto-pilot and start the descent. Given the weather; rain and St. Elmo sparking wildly I asked him to renegade the autopilot. I was still unable to get dispatch although they had provided a frequency to try. While descending I took note of cabin altitude but the conditions were very difficult at this point. I attempted a reset of packs again. We had now been cleared to 10000. At some point the cabin altitude warning came on during our descent at which point we took our O2 masks out and did our memory items. We remained in very difficult conditions due to rain; turbulence and St. Elmo to the point it was almost blinding in cockpit. I attempted several times to silence horn but due to the turbulence it was difficult to get my hand on the button. Once communications were established I tasked FO to [advise ATC] and we were going to ZZZ. We also decide that any faster descent would prove dangerous due to weather conditions. I attempted one last time to bring dispatch into loop on comm 2 and decide to send ACARS message 'diverting to ZZZ.' At some point we finally flew out of the weather and leveled off at 10000. The FO wanted to run the QRH for loss of cabin pressurization but I decided to finish the items on QRH for pack given we were now at 10000. I was now finally able to inform the FA of our situation and tell them what we were doing. Interestingly enough they did not inform me the mask had dropped in the back. I only was aware of that at gate when mechanic met us. We set up and executed landing at ZZZ. Fire rescue followed us to the gate and we completed the remaining required checklist. The mechanics met us and we briefed them and sent Maintenance writeups via ACARS. I called the Duty Manager. I inquired or requested a bit of guidance being a rather new Captain and the situation that just happened. Several things stand out from my conversation. First he basically wanted us to stay with airplane because again they wanted it in ZZZ2. He informed me they would possibly fix it and we would be legal to continue. I told him about the mask deploying and I felt that was doubtful. He also said there is a checklist he could run but seemed to think it wasn't really required. We waited and the FO and I debriefed. I was called back by the Duty Manager stating we would go to the hotel and ferry flight in morning. Crew scheduling decided minimum rest would be enough and built our ferry flight. We never flew that flight.The next morning I called the Union Chairman to get some advice on how to proceed. I never heard back. I also called another union rep because we were being pushed to ferry the flight and after reflection I thought it was vastly unfair to a new hire to force him to fly after such a difficult scenario. Union rep called me back and did call the FO. I also would like it to be noted the outstanding job the FO did during this incredibly difficult situation. There is irony that now the company has elected to remove us from flying while an investigation is being conducted when they seemed willing to fly us right back that morning twice.

We called Dispatch to change the flight plan to circumvent the storm. Dispatch seemed lazy and uninterested in our request. The Captain was able to convince Dispatch to file an alternate route and asked Dispatch if they needed to call ATC to coordinate. Apparently; they did not.It was night; with decreased flying from COVID-19. There's no congestion that would have prevented Company Dispatch and Clearance Delivery to plan us a safe route. We received a second Release with a revised flight plan. I called Clearance. Clearance said I had two flight plans filed and read back the route of the original Release. I told him that was the wrong one and Clearance Delivery replied with; 'Read back correct.' He didn't listen or care. I called again and asked for my new routing. Before I could finish speaking; clearance began talking; so I didn't hear the first part of what he said. It was basically; we can't do it.My Captain called clearance and asked again.

At this point; I became verbal and wanted a good reason why we can't stay in the clear 30 minutes outside of Denver. ATC basically said Denver just closed the southeast arrivals. I said something like you have got to be kidding me; if I had 10 choices; they gave us the 10th choice between two lines of weather with moderate turbulence and mountain wave and I again was displeased and wanted a good explanation. He said TMU (Traffic Management) is doing this to everyone; so I asked for the number; and talked with a [controller] who was in charge at the time. I have been with the airline for XX years and seeing more and more of this TMU routing that is always 4 to 6 hours behind schedule and dispatchers agreed. The reroute added 200 miles and 40 minutes and not one controller asks the question; 'Can you do this' new route?

315,315,315,315,9870,Aircraft X departed ZZZ Southeast bound. He wanted to stay at 3000 MSL due to the ceiling and possible icing conditions. About 20 miles Southeast of the airport; he reported that he wanted lower but due to the MVA; he could only go to 3000 MSL. He then elected to return to the airport. Once he was within 15 miles of the airport; he was descended to 2600 MSL. The plan was to try to get him to get the Visual Approach but as the aircraft kept flying; it was clear that he was going to have to go out for the ILS. He needed lower than 2600 due to icing so I gave him a 090 degree heading and stated the MVA and told him altitude his discretion. As the aircraft started to descend; I had my hand off call up to the tower to get the lights on high and had another person in the RADAR room get the supervisor. The pilot reported that the visibility was getting better as he got lower and I asked him if he had ground contact. He said yes so I cleared him for a Contact Approach. The Low Altitude Alert went off after I cleared him for the approach so I did not give him the Low Altitude Alert phraseology. The pilot landed without trouble and taxied off the runway. I gave the pilot a Contact Approach without him requesting it. Also; the Low Altitude Alert went off as the aircraft was 6 miles West Northwest of the airport.  Since I already stated the MVA; I did not give him the Low Altitude Alert phraseology.

I am uncertain of where the actual leak was. I had advised the First Officer that we would be declaring an emergency; which we did and turned back. Due to this unique situation; we had looked for a specific emergency checklist but none existed. We had approximately 4;500 LBS at the time we noticed the issue.

317,317,317,317,7416,We were descending on the CAMPS3 arrival to ILS 2 with auto pilot on and with airspeed of 240 knots intervened. We were informed that there were reports of light to moderate chop between 4500 and 3500 feet but that the reports were over an hour old. I informed the Flight Attendants of impending chop and to stow everything and be seated. After HARPO we were given a heading turning us more northerly inside of CAMPS. Passing 4700 feet we started picking up light to moderate chop which quickly escalated to moderate to severe by 4000 feet. In a right angle of bank in open descent with partial speed brakes passing 3700 feet airspeed trend arrow was fluctuating +- 40 knots and instruments were becoming difficult to read. Though in a descent; the next thing we knew we had climbed back up above 4500 feet and airspeed had bled off to near the amber foot. Next; the Auto Pilot kicked off and it was difficult to know what we had as the instruments were difficult to read so I declared 'ESCAPE' and 'TOGA'; selected TOGA and stowed the speed brakes. Passing 6000 feet the aircraft settled down so we could see what we had and so I reinstated Auto Pilot 1; selected Climb Power and continued the climb to 7000 feet. We then informed HFC that we had experienced up to severe turbulence. They seemed very surprised at the report as they had no adverse reports recently. They suggested that we could approach the airport from the south instead of the west and might bypass the rough air. We agreed and they turned us south to intercept the Glide Slope out near CAMPS. The ride seemed better well south of the field near CAMPS so we slowed to 210 and configured to flaps 1 at 3000 feet. The airspeed trend arrow was still fluctuating +- 10 knots. About 5 NM from the IAF the turbulence picked up again and within seconds the airspeed had increased over 40 knots. We had 2 moments where the airspeed exceeded the flaps 1 barber pole and we got the accompanying aural warning. We once again reported the severe turbulence asked for a higher altitude and declared that we would be diverting to ZZZ. Once we were climbing and had established our routing to ZZZ; I made a brief announcement to the people that we were fine and were on our way to ZZZ. I then sent a divert report to dispatch via ACARS. I received a reply from dispatch surprised at my report and questioning if I was truly diverting. I replied yes due to severe turbulence.

319,319,319,319,7877,On previous leg; the aircraft had multiple nuisance ANTI-SKID FAIL alerts while taxiing prior to takeoff. Alert only came on when setting the parking brake in line for takeoff. We complied with the QRH. After running the Anti-Skid Test; it passed the test and we moved to the MEL. Because the test passed; we concluded that we had a good system; decided to not use the parking brake while taxiing for takeoff; thus avoiding the re-occurrence of the alert. Our interpretation of the MEL was that if the alert remained; being a flagged item; we would turn back to the gate for maintenance action. After the successful completion of the Anti-Skid Test; and not setting the parking brake; we had no further alerts that leg of the flight. It was written up by the Captain in deferral log; and shown closed in the maintenance log upon arrival for the leg back to the departure airport. There was no incidence with the anti-skid on start up through takeoff on the leg return leg. Upon approach; while performing the before landing checklist; a level 2 ANTI-SKID R FAIL was annunciated. We were at about 1;500 FT AGL just inside final approach fix. The Captain; also the pilot flying; elected to execute a go-around. The release had us planned for 15;673 [LBS of] fuel at touchdown. We were 2;000 LBS heavy on cargo which increased our fuel burn by 200 LBS. We had about a; 18 minute delay with approach due to being stuck behind an Airbus for most of the route. Added up; we were right at 15;000 LBS at the time of the go-around; if not slightly below. Once safely on the climb to 3;000 FT; runway heading; as assigned by Tower; we contacted Approach for vectors to our next landing. We were assigned 09 and turned downwind. We then ran the QRH for the ANTI-SKID R FAIL with steel brakes. This time the alert did not remain extinguished. We decided to perform the recommended 50/EXT landing. Following the QRH procedure completion; we were turned to a base leg for the ILS to visual Runway 09. While configuring the aircraft for landing; we noticed that the fuel was 12;400 LBS at around 500 FT AGL. After landing on Runway 09; we rolled out the full length; used full reverse thrust (never above approximately 85% N1) and the Captain did not use the brakes until the turn off at the end. Clear of the runway; we turned the anti-skid off as per the QRH. We then taxied to our spot and parked. The Captain documented the ANTI-SKID R FAIL in the maintenance log. My concern is that we were planned to land with a nominal amount of fuel; without delays. Not factored into that calculation was the 18 minute en route/arrival delay nor the go-around for a maintenance issue. We touched down at about 1;000 LBS above emergency fuel; thanks to a helpful Approach Control; and timely reactions of the crew. Had Runway 09 not been available; we may have had a compounded incident with maintenance issues and emergency fuel issues. A more thorough inspection of the Anti-Skid System may have discovered the reason for the multiple alerts we encountered in flight and on the ground. Then again; it may not have. Anticipating this alert; given the multiple occurrences on the previous leg; and possibly getting the gear down earlier; could have given us more time to quickly run the QRH while level on extended final.,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

A VFR target was observed coming off of the OPF/HWO area VFR climbing to the northwest; through both FLL finals. Aircraft X was issued the traffic and could not descend on the approach because the VFR was climbing unrestricted and uncontrolled.

323,323,323,323,6672,I was the Pilot Flying. The flight was uneventful until the approach. This was my first time into PSP in a long time and the Captain had only been in there a few times previously. We were able to get the METAR only while en route and it was reporting the wind VRB at 4 knots. This left us guessing on what runway they were using; but saw in the forecast that the wind would be shifting to the northwest. We decided to set up for the RNAV visual to 31L. About 15 minutes out; we received the voice ATIS which confirmed 31L.  We checked on with SoCal Approach and they said expect vectors for the visual to 31L. Since we were both pretty unfamiliar with the airport and with all the high terrain; we were more comfortable with the RNAV visual and requested that. We received a vector out to the north of SBONO and a descent to 7;000 feet. The airport was in sight almost the entire time we were vectored. However; as we were getting closer to SBONO the sun was creating a lot of visibility issues and we lost sight of the field. There was also a lot of haze and the mountain behind the airport cast a shadow over it making it very difficult to see.  We also noticed our descent to 7;000 feet took us below what's published at SBONO; which says to cross at or above 7;500 feet. We asked the Controller to confirm we were cleared to 7;000 feet and he responded 'that's what I was told.' We were sort of confused by the response but could see that terrain would be no factor. I was still a little unsure if we would be given direct to SBONO or another intermediate fix. A few miles from SBONO we were given direct to it and to report the airport in sight. We could not see the airport at this time due to setting sun. We both were trying to visually acquire it and became distracted with it. During that time; I set 1;300 feet in the altitude selector and we were in VNAV path. I think I announced to the Captain 'That is what I was doing;' but can't say with certainty. The aircraft was in VNAV PATH; so after crossing SBONO; it started descending to cross WEMIR at or above 6;000 feet. At about 6;400 feet; the Controller came on and said to stop the descent and climb back to 6;600 ft. and that we were not cleared for the visual approach and we need to report the airport in sight. We climbed up to 6;600 feet which he said was the minimum vectoring altitude. We continued flying the lateral portion now becoming really high. We still couldn't see the field and the Controller said he couldn't get us a descent even though according to the chart we could be at 4;000 feet. Eventually we located the airport and he cleared us for the visual approach. We were configured and able to get back on path to execute a stable approach. The rest of the flight was uneventful.  The lighting conditions made our visual approach very difficult. I should have better communicated the setting of a lower altitude and made sure the Captain agreed with it. I must say; the attitude and helpfulness of this Controller was poor. The response we got when verifying an altitude was non-standard and unprofessional. Our clearance was also not very clear but we should have verified it before descending. Sometimes a little more communication from the Controllers helps so we have a more shared mental model. I think putting a little more on the Company page could help because I was not really sure what to expect as far as an approach going in.

325,325,325,325,5393,Today's lesson began as a simulated IFR flight. During preflight the weather of the destination airport was 6 SM and my student decided to complete the flight. I am new to the Glass cockpit Cessna 172 and my Chief Pilot specifically instructed me 'VFR only'. During our cruise I was playing with the G1000; trying to understand the system better and be able to teach to my students. Before I realized [it]; the visibility went from +6 to less than 1. Immediately I asked for a pop up IFR clearance to my destination. Having received my clearance I began setting up the GPS for navigation purposes and situational awareness. I then recalled the instructions from my Chief Pilot; 'VFR only' and realized the need to return. I asked for a return clearance back; without canceling my IFR clearance. ATC asked me if I wanted to cancel; but the visibility was still poor and realizing I needed my clearance; I opted not to cancel. Without receiving a new clearance I deviated from my course and began a descent to the proper IFR altitude. I understand the mistake I have made today - FAR 91.123 No PIC may deviate from a clearance unless an amended clearance has been received; an emergency exists; or a alert on the TCAS system. I asked ATC for a clearance to return back; however I did not receive my clearance before beginning a descent and turn. However what I did know were the Minimum Enroute Altitudes for the Victor Airways I was most near and all have a MEA of at or above 3;000. I am not using this as an excuse; and I completely admit that the deviation of FAR 91.123 was a blatant lack of thinking and patience on my behalf. I have always found that I learn most from my mistakes; never have I violated an IFR clearance; but my IFR experience is not extensive. For this reason I chose to be a flight instructor. To learn from my mistakes and to teach from my own experiences.

331,331,331,331,1410,[In the evening]; my student went out to Aircraft X to perform his preflight check. Attached to the clip board was a sticky note stating that the fuel level was at least 3/4 full. Per the checklist; he dipped the fuel tank and read approx 3/4 full. A few minutes later I joined him at the plane and dipped the tank myself. I also read approx 3/4 full of full. Both of us agreed that the fuel load was enough for a 1.5 hour flight. Before takeoff; I noticed a discrepancy between the fuel gauge and the level that my student and I believed was on board. It read slightly lower; than what we believed was on board; but not so much so to cause me concern due to the unreliable nature of the fuel gauge during previous flights. We departed without incident; and flew to ZZZ1 and practiced pattern procedures there. After approx .5 of flying; we departed ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 to continue pattern work. While departing ZZZ1; we looked at the fuel gauge and noticed it indicated lower than 1/4 full. At this point we discussed the possibility that the fuel level was low and what to do. We both confirmed with each other that the fuel level had been 3/4 full before the flight. We had originally planned to do multiple landings at ZZZ2 but decided to return to ZZZ after one; fearing a possible leak; but believing we still had at least 1/2 tank. We entered the pattern at ZZZ and performed another two landings; still believing that the fuel gauge was faulty. After completion of the second landing at ZZZ; the fuel gauge had dropped to zero and the engine stopped during takeoff roll. We stopped the aircraft on the runway without incident. After reporting our situation to ZZZ tower; we secured the aircraft and dipped the fuel tank once more to find it empty after 1.2 hours of flight time.Either a mechanical defect caused fuel starvation or an error reading the fuel level by three separate people. In either situation; the fuel gauge was accurate. Having encountered previous instances with inaccurate fuel gauges; I did not trust the reading the gauge was giving me. I believed a visual reading was more accurate.

In doing so the pushback kept rolling towards the towbar when I eventually tried to stop it with the foot brakes. I attempted the hand brake but to no avail. At this time it had hit the connected towbar with the front already rolling over the towbar. By this time I already tried the two brakes and the emergency switch. But one of the pushback front wheels was already on top of the tow bar when it rolled over and to avert hitting the nose gear I steered it away from the plane and then finally was able to bring it to a complete stop by pulling the lever into park. I then called the lead who call the supervisor and the managers. I think because I didn't panic in such an event or I would have hit the aircraft head on.

335,335,335,335,5471,South of Moscow and a few minutes south of AMUTI both GPS dropped offline. It took the jet a few minutes for us to see 'unable RNP' but our first indication was a solid yellow line under the PFD and then on the bottom of the ND the RNP was 2.00/2.67 'inertial' in yellow. It felt like solid 2-3 mins before we saw the 'unable RNP'. To that point we were discussing why we weren't seeing it. I was in the checklist looking for the 'unable RNP' when we received the EICAS msg. We enabled radio updating which almost immediately brought us back to .06 ANP. But on the position reference page 3/3 the GPS info was blank so now the discussion became why we are not seeing 'GPS Inop'. We never did see that. The GPS was blank for 5-10 mins before it came back online but when it did it was intermittent for a few mins; I took this as a normal boot up. While it was fixing itself the GPS would jump to 2.50 ANP and .06 ANP jumping between the two distances several times over 10-15 minutes. Radio updating had limited effectiveness due to the limited VORs in the area. The Inertial solution showed an ANP of 19.6 the entire time; but wasn't a factor using/depending on it due to Radio and GPS updates were more accurate. We also saw a jump from RNP 2 to 4.

336,336,336,336,10449,On the morning of this event; I was finishing up a lesson with my CFI as I'm working toward my Commercial Rating. We were doing a variety of landings; so far touch and go; on Runway 36. Then we decided to do a stop and go.The landing was fine until I went to apply brakes. My left brake failed and I veered hard to the right. I did not have the ability to correct and steer back to the left. I believe if I tried to steer really hard back the other way I may have lost control or hit a taxi light.My right wheel (main) went off the runway as well as nose wheel and onto the grass. The grass area was a flat surface and we didn't hit anything. I informed the Tower that I had a braking issue and requested permission to taxi back. The Tower gave me permission to taxi back to the ramp.I had to proceed ahead and further onto the grass to turn around to the right and get lined up on the centerline of the runway. There were no other aircraft involved. No injuries and no damage to the club aircraft that I was flying.I did not notice a braking issue prior to departure. I did check the brakes while taxing prior to departure. I initially did not think there was as issue as far as needing to report this because nothing 'bad' happened as a result and the Tower did not ask me to contact them. I was informed by the Airport Manager that because it is still considered to be part of the landing that it qualifies as part of the flight; and therefore it is a reportable event. He told me not to worry about it because the FAA is shut down anyway but for future reference I should notify him. The Airport Manager had been misinformed from another source unknown to me; that this event occurred at night after the Tower was closed; which is not correct information (which my have been why he was contacting the club about it to begin with). I did squawk the brake failure right away on the flight club website which sends a notification to the Maintenance Team. The Head Maintenance Officer was called and an email was sent out to the entire club. I also notified the next person on the schedule. The plane was sent to the garage on field for follow-up maintenance.Another club CFI informed me that this isn't an issue since the Tower didn't feel it was an issue. I wasn't sure what to do in this case because it partially left the runway because of brake failure; and then fully left the runway surface to turn around to get back into position to taxi.The reason I'm filing this report is because I'm not clear as to who at the airport has authority over reporting this type of event and whether or not it is necessary. I was under the impression that the Tower had jurisdiction. However; after speaking to the Airport Manager; felt that I may be reported or need to report this.Due to time constraints; I felt compelled to file this report. I am traveling currently. I know I will need to review the FAR's to determine what types of things I need to report. I will follow up with some research.,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
337,337,337,337,3498,On final approach to Runway 34 the aircraft was stabilized and we were set for a touch and go. Winds were approx ten gusting fifteen knots about ten degrees west of runway heading. My student had full control of the aircraft until five feet off the ground. A gust of wind picked up the left wing causing the aircraft to bank well over thirty degrees. I immediately applied full left rudder while taking control from my student. At this point our airspeed was insufficient to perform a go around. When the plane touched down on the runway we were to the east of center line approximately twenty feet facing the grass/taxiway. I'm estimating fifty degrees to the right is where the nose of the aircraft ended up. I could not stop the aircraft before rolling off the runway through tall grass and onto the parallel taxiway facing northbound. After parking the aircraft on the ramp I called my company to report. Our chief pilot sent one of our A&P Mechanics to inspect the plane to see if we needed a ferry permit. After a complete inspection was done we came to the conclusion that the damage was limited to the wing tip and about an inch of paint was scrapped off the aileron. I believed; as well as the mechanic; that this was cosmetic damage only. All this was reported back to the head of Maintenance and my Chief Pilot. After clearing the flight with my Company I was instructed to and flew the aircraft back to our facility. My Chief did ask if I felt comfortable flying it back; which I did. The following morning I was notified that after further inspections done by our maintenance in the hangar that the wing spar may be bent out of shape causing the aircraft to be UN-airworthy. Human Factors: I believe that I did everything possible to recover the aircraft from this unusual condition. I reacted as soon as I could to correct the aircraft. This was the third flight of my day and I was not tired and well rested from the previous night. I relied heavily on the mechanics advice and expertise in the decision to fly the aircraft back to our facility.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
338,338,338,338,2061,I was the pilot not flying for this flight. In cruise at FL360 with the seatbelt sign off; we started getting some occasional light chop. Shortly thereafter; around 80 miles southeast of DSM; the Captain requested that I check with ATC about getting FL380. I asked Center how the rides were at FL380 and the Controller responded that she had just handed [a B747] off at FL380 and he hadn't said a word; so she assumed it was smooth. Much earlier in the flight we had seen the B747 overhead and I noticed that it was now a little over 10 miles ahead of us on the TCAS display. I then requested FL380 and received clearance to climb to FL380.As soon as the climb was initiated; the ride smoothed out. While passing FL374 we started getting light chop again. The Captain commented that it was unfortunate we were getting the chop again now that we were getting near our altitude. Passing FL375; the aircraft began to quickly roll to the right and the control wheel displaced to the left as the autopilot tried to correct. The aircraft continued to roll to the right and passing about 25 degrees of bank; the Captain turned off the autopilot and increased the roll correction to the left. The aircraft continued to roll right beyond 35 degrees of bank before the Captain was able to stop the roll at which time we heard a loud thud in from the forward galley. The Captain was then able to return the aircraft to wings level. We were now at FL376 and the Captain asked to go back to FL360. I called Center; indicated that we believed we had gotten in someone's wake and would like to return to FL360. The Controller cleared us to return to FL360 and indicated that the [aircraft] a little over 10 miles ahead of us at FL380 was a B747. The autopilot was reengaged and we returned to FL360. The Captain then called the Purser on the interphone and she informed him that a galley cart had overturned in the forward galley and had hit a Flight Attendant in the thigh as it was falling. The Purser informed us that the affected Flight Attendant was indicating that she was OK and did not believe she was injured at that time. The purser relayed to us that the aft flight attendants had reported that they were all OK and the passengers all appeared to be OK. Also; the purser reported that some male passengers in first class had come up to the front galley and stood the galley cart back up and that nothing appeared to be damaged. The Captain then made a PA to the passengers while I flew the aircraft and monitored ATC. After his PA; he resumed the flying duties and I returned to pilot not flying duties. I reassured the passengers that everything was OK with the aircraft and updated them on our anticipated arrival time. After discussion with the Captain; since we did not encounter any load on the aircraft during the roll or severe turbulence; no logbook entry was made. The remainder of the flight was uneventful.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
339,339,339,339,4485,In cruise FL390 we encountered strong wave action over ABQ VOR. Airspeed increased 10 KTS and altitude increased plus 200 FT. The autoflight system corrected with a large thrust reduction. Then our airspeed dropped 30 KTS and altitude dropped 400 FT from our peak. We nosed the aircraft down in an effort to maintain airspeed. I called ATC and advised them of our immediate descent. We encountered moderate turbulence during the descent. We leveled at FL370. No injuries to passengers or crew because they were seated and galleys were secure. No airframe limits were reached.

340,340,340,340,3112,We got to the aircraft with snow falling during preflight duties. The Captain and I talked about the weather and both agreed we needed a two-step deice/anti-ice application. With ATIS reporting -SN; BR (mist); temp of +2 C.  We determined we could not use the 'snowfall intensities as a function of prevailing visibility' chart to determine snowfall intensities because of *1 note at bottom of chart.  The note states 'Use this table when snow is the ONLY reported precipitation and visibility is not being reduced by other forms of obscuration (e.g.; fog [FG]; mist [BR].' Using established company policies and procedures the holdover time was calculated using the Clariant Safewing Type IV chart for the current weather conditions.Type IV Clariant Safewing at -3 and above @ 100% was started at time. Approximately 8 to 10 minutes later the deicing crew informed us we had a clean aircraft and the 2 step was complete. The captain and I used the holdover times tables from the cockpit to determine a very conservative (moderate versus light) holdover time of 0:49-1:20. Just prior to taking the runway for takeoff we performed a flight deck check and we could see no contamination on the aircraft. The takeoff was conducted without incident and landed also without incident.

341,341,341,341,7081,Shortly after takeoff we received a bird strike in our Number 1 Engine that caused considerable damage. Based on the engine vibration as well as the unusual noises coming from the aircraft; we determined it was necessary to immediately return for landing at ZZZ. I received priority with air traffic control and the First Officer continued flying the aircraft. There were no ECAM actions or QRH follow ups. Although there were high vibration indications as well as some initial fluctuations with N1; N2 and EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature); the engine parameters remained in the realm of normal. Therefore; the First Officer and myself did not see any reason for shutting the engine down in flight. We landed safely; let the airport personnel do a quick inspection of the aircraft on the taxiway and then returned to the gate.It all went fairly well. There was a startle factor with this event. But; in general we followed everything we learned in training. However; I may have delegated the re-configuring of the aircraft to the First Officer a bit too soon. He did that on his own. It was all done correctly. But; I don't remember doing the normal acceleration altitude call outs. I did all the standard communication procedures to ATC; cabin crew; passengers and Dispatch. Then; rejoined the First Officer for the approach preparation. The First Officer handled flying the aircraft as well as his communication with ATC perfectly.There is nothing that I can suggest that would prevent this from happening again. We always have to contend with the hazards associated with migratory waterfowl.

342,342,342,342,7962,The event happened in Houston Approach airspace. We were just starting to descend VIA the GESNR at 14;000. At GESNR we encountered moderate to severe wake turbulence. We were about 12 nm behind a B747. The Controller advised us that we were following the B747. Upon encountering the wake; the autopilot disconnected as the aircraft rolled 30+ degrees. Once we regained control of the aircraft the Captain immediately checked on our FA. She was fine and was able to brace herself and avoid injury. The seatbelt sign was also on at the time of the encounter. After checking on the FA; the Captain reported the encounter to the Controller. ATC allowed us to pull our speed to attempt to avoid any other encounters. We should have laterally offset or ATC should have given us more space. We were level and flew right through the path of the 747.

343,343,343,343,10329,Took off early to avoid approaching weather and first 45 minutes of the flight was uneventful. Throughout the flight I was following XM weather and was planning to divert to Newport News if needed. However; the forecast indicated the front was stationary which turned out to be spot on. As I got closer I updated my plans and thought about landing at Norfolk. When Norfolk Approach cleared me for the ILS 5 to CPK via NALDE I paused. I had been listening to CPK's AWOS for some time and knew the wind was fine; the ceiling was 800 FT; with good visibility and distant lightning. This matched up nicely with what XM weather was showing so I felt comfortable completing the flight as filed. However; I noted that NALDE (IF/IAF) was in the yellow returns and likely the distant convective activity noted on the AWOS. I said unable and requested the GPS 23 approach. After a short pause ATC came back and cleared me to CPK via the GPS 23 approach and give me vectors to the IAF (Norfolk VOR at 3;000 FT). This was the first indication that ATC would put me into danger. Approaching CPK from the south was NOT a safe option for a light aircraft. I programmed my GPS and about this time a close lighting strike energized the skin of the plane; which doesn't have static wicks. The result was being able to transmit 5x5 but just barely make out ATC over what seemed like a very loud failed squelch. This was determined by a radio check with Norfolk. I broke out my standby radio but just flying the airplane required all my attention so I didn't try to tune it. Things settled down; the radio reception got progressively better and I even broke out into the clear for a bit and ATC asked my how the ride was which I informed them it was currently pretty darn good. No sooner had I spoken when I was back in the woods working to keep the CDI centered as the plane jerked around. Everything was going as planned when ATC vectored me to ZIMON (IF). I accepted the change; reprogrammed the GPS and when the CDI centered I was in a right bank and had lost 200 FT. I corrected and noted my new course to ZIMON and twisted the CDI outer ring and proceeded. The turbulence made changing anything difficult and the rain was very heavy. Heavy like if you were driving on the freeway you would pull over vice continuing on. Just as I got things settled; ATC vectored me to FUBSY (FAF) at this time all I wanted to do is get to ZIMON and fly 228 degrees to the runway following the approach plate. I felt because I had accepted ZIMON I didn't really have a choice but to accept FUBSY. ATC basically turned my FAF into the IAF. At this point I was sure ATC was trying to put me into danger and I was getting angry. I acknowledge ATC and programmed the GPS. When done I was in a right dive with wings at nearly 40 degrees and had lost 400 FT. I was in an unusual attitude and if not for my training and a working attitude indicator I would have been a statistic. I'm not sure how close I came to FUBSY but just as I was going to call missed I broke out; saw the runway REIL; told ATC I had the runway in sight and canceled my clearance. The landing was uneventful and actually one of my best. As I taxied up to the fueling area the sky opened up and the rain I had just been flying though seemed to have followed me. I taxied to the ramp and called the Tower in the hopes of finding out what I had done to the Controller to justify him to try and kill me. I talked to his Supervisor and he let me know that none of the controllers currently on watch were pilots that they were just doing what they had been trained to do. My Controller was vectoring me around his airspace to maintain separation for Norfolk's traffic and that if I needed the full approach I should have asked for it. I got the impression that the RNAV (GPS) Runway 23 for CPK is actually NEVER flown as published. Two days later I went flying with my former CFII and told him what happened and we practiced intercepts; holding and conducted three approaches. I specifically requested the RNAV (GPS) 23 to CPK 'full approach' and Norfolk responded UNABLE. The plane that I fly is a very capable IFR platform and I feel it can safely fly in hard IFR with green returns. Having ATC initially attempt to vector me into yellow returns that could actually be red due to XM weather lag is unacceptable. Not understanding that a GA plane in turbulent; heavy rain IFR might want to fly an approach as published resulted in me nearly staining my shorts or worse. Turning a FAF into the IAF for no apparent reason other than to get me down sooner or keep the airspace 'clear' is unacceptable. If Norfolk's SOP is to typically not allow the RNAV (GPS) Runway 23 at CPK to be flow as published this should be noted on the plate. I've studied this approach many times and the runway alignment and the approach give a new pilot no indication that Norfolk would not want to allow pilots to fly this as published. Just the opposite; the published approach seems better in clearing the airspace than multiple vectors turning a FAF into the IAF. I do want to say the Controller I worked with was very friendly as he tried to kill me. NOTE - During the last 20 minutes of the flight the autopilot was turned off; as it wasn't able to keep up with the increasing turbulence.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
344,344,344,344,3459,After being vectored over the airport and sequenced behind multiple heavy jets; I was cleared for the visual approach to 35R at SDF. The last vector to final was a shallow intercept angle and I mistakenly identified a warehouse as being part of the [company] ramp. This led to partial spatial disorientation which allowed me to believe I was 1.5 miles from the airport instead of the actual 2.5 miles. The tower controller gave me an altitude alert and the altimeter setting; which prompted me to add power and reevaluate my location to the airport. I then reset my glide path and had a stabilized approach to landing with no further issues. I believe a contributing factor was the lengthy duty day that also included a stop at SDF about 10 hours earlier. Additionally;  I was vectored over the airport and looked down at the airport environment to identify the [company] ramps and the FBO ramp where I would be offloading/loading freight; which added to my belief that I had correctly identified part of the airport environment. To prevent this from happening; I could have switched my CDI to follow the ILS (which I had loaded).

347,347,347,347,2751,I was on a VFR flight from ZZZ to SJC. Weather at SJC was IFR; legal but below my personal minimum; and forecast to improve to VFR by the time of my arrival. I had flown this route under similar conditions many times before. In flight; I checked TIS-B weather at surrounding airports and noted that both E16 and WVI were reporting clear. I decided to reroute to E16 if conditions at SJC did not improve. Several times during the flight SJC reported improved conditions; not to VFR but high enough ceiling that I requested and received clearance for the ILS 30L Approach. I joined the localizer outside of KLIDE and captured the glideslope soon thereafter; watching as the auto-pilot controlled the descent. Only the last few miles of the approach were under the low overcast. As I emerged below the clouds; the Tower Controller gave me a low altitude alert. Believing I was on glideslope; I was surprised. Looking below; I saw SAP Arena but for unknown reason took that as a sign that I was already past the field. I may have confused it for Levi's Stadium; a totally different sports complex on the far side of SJC in this NW-bound direction. I declared a missed approach and climbed out. Tower turned me over to NORCAL Approach who vectored me for a second try. The controller asked why I had gone missed and I told him my best guess at the time which was that when I had emerged from the clouds I was already past the field. On the second approach; I was vectored to join the localizer near HIVAK; the FAF; well above the glideslope. I descended rapidly; wanting to intercept the GS from below. The auto-pilot never captured the glideslope and I again went too low. This time; however; I recognized SAP Arena as I emerged from the clouds and understood where I was and what I had done wrong on the first approach. I told the Tower Controller that I was visual; proceeded another mile to where I could see the runway; and made a normal landing. I made several mistakes on this flight: I misunderstood my position when transitioning from IMC to VMC on the first approach. I should have continued to rely on the instruments until I had the runway in sight. The low altitude alert should not have rattled me. When vectored around to the FAF on the second approach while still held at an uncomfortably high altitude; I could have requested a longer downwind leg to get below the glideslope. I plan to discuss this situation with a CFII to learn better how to handle a tight turn-in.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
348,348,348,348,10029,Arriving into BOI from the north; we planned a visual approach that would be backed up by the RNAV X 28R. Upon check-in with ATC; we were told to expect clearance for the RNAV X. As we approached the IAF; however; ATC said that we would be following another carrier aircraft that was approximately four miles ahead of us on downwind. We advised that aircraft was in sight and we were cleared for a visual approach behind other carrier.Seeing that spacing would be an issue if we were to remain on the RNAV track; I slowed the aircraft and went into heading mode to extend the downwind. Just as we started to turn base; we received a Terrain Caution. I disengaged the autopilot and autothrottles and initiated a climb. The alert ended; and we maneuvered to the south to remain clear.Because we were hemmed in by terrain to the east and north and by the other carrier aircraft to our south; we probably should not have accepted the approach clearance.

349,349,349,349,2805,We were flying a right downwind to land on Runway 16 in AVL.  Weather was VMC 8SM; SKC; winds 170/7G17.  The visual approach was briefed and flown according to SOP.  Due to some of the rising terrain features around AVL the EGPWS produced a terrain advisory.  We were descending while turning right base for Runway 16 when the warning was received.  The Captain increased power and pitch to comply with the warning; [climbed] approximately 200 FT; which cleared the warning.  We extended our downwind due to our close lateral proximity with the runway; executed a turn to final; and landed [from] a stabilized visual approach without incident.  The EGPWS alert lasted for approximately 5 seconds.  Captain was Pilot Flying; I was the Pilot Not Flying.  The EGPWS terrain advisory was produced due to the close proximity of the lower level terrain to the west of AVL.

350,350,350,350,2922,I departed ZZZ out to the North Practice area; outside the Class C airspace for routine training maneuvers in a Cessna 172.  The sky's were clear and full VMC. During the maneuvers I began to get airsick after I pulled open the cabin heat system.  After some time of using the cabin heat I closed the system and continued my training maneuvers thinking the airsickness would go away since it has never been a problem.  During my maneuvers I began to get cold again so I opened the cabin heat again and continued more maneuvers.  I continued to get airsick. During this period; I think about 30 minutes into the flight; I thought I smelled exhaust so I immediately opened the overhead cabin vents; opened the window and closed cabin heat.  I still felt alert so I did not consider myself impaired; just nauseated.  I picked up the ZZZ ATIS then contacted approach to return to ZZZ.  Approach instructed me to stay in the practice area due to traffic.  I continued circling in the area waiting for Approach to allow me to return.  I think by this time I had been flying for about an hour; not sure. I believe I was flying around 3000 feet. I continued to circle; but eventually started calling Approach to see if I could return because I wasn't feeling any better; but felt worse.  I am not sure if I was missing their radio calls.I eventually received permission to return on a heading of 150.  I turned to 150 and entered the Class C airspace.  Approximately 5 miles from the field I was informed I would be performing a box pattern to allow traffic to land ZZZ.  Approach or Tower (I can't remember) gave me a left turn to 100.  I remember immediately turning to the right thinking this would be more direct.  I realized I was confused and asked the controller to verify a left turn to 100 is really what they wanted me to do.  They confirmed the instructions so I made a left turn to 100 thinking this would be a complete 360 turn to 100 from my current heading of 150.  When I came to 100 I realized I was confused and this is when I realized I may be impaired due to CO poisoning.  ATC came back and asked be to make a left turn to 360 which I did and I believe I did acknowledge the instruction.  Some time after turning north I remember hearing ATC asking me if I copied their last transmission; which I realized I must have missed their call.  I responded by stating that I did not hear their transmission and that I was getting confused with their instructions and that I believe I was suffering from CO poisoning.  I believe I asked them to get me back to the airport as soon as they could.ATC gave me an immediate clearance to land runway 28.  I was able to turn the plane to 28 although I was very tired by this time.  During the final visual approach I noticed I was a little slow in responding to airspeed and power changes; but I was able to land the plane and taxi off the runway.  I met the fire trucks and sat on the taxi way for a while catching my breath.  I told ATC I thought I could taxi the plane to parking.  After parking the plane; EMTs met me at the plane.  I did not realize how impaired I was until the EMT's asked me some questions.  I remember the EMT asking me my name and I could not immediately tell him.  He then asked me how many quarters are in a dollar.  I could not remember and I had to take some time to figure out the answer.  I am writing this to inform of my experiencing and what I remember during the events and also to inform that I was able to land the aircraft without an accident.

353,353,353,353,8380,Just after completing a climb to 12;000 ft in an attempt to get above an icing layer; the company issued iPad mount fell off the windscreen on to the floor. Initially; I reacted to this by reaching down to pick it up; but simultaneously noticed the G600 displayed a GPS failure indication on the moving map side of the screen. At the same time TAWS (terrain awareness and warning system) gave an aural alert 'TAWS NOT AVAILABLE'. There were no additional audible alerts or visual annunciations. I initially thought this was simply a GPS signal failure and was starting to react accordingly; I then observed that the aircraft had entered a descending turn and immediately reacted with an unusual attitude in IMC recovery procedure. Given that the aircraft was in continuous light turbulence; in the clouds; at night; I was momentarily completely focused on ensuring the aircraft remained in a controlled attitude. A few moments latter I began taking stock of what I did and did not have. I observed the GMX200 screen off; GNS530 screen off; the primary GTX330 was off; and the autopilot was off. The G600 was giving associated GPS/AHRS and GAD43 failures. There were no other annunciations on the primary panel; and no audible alerts. My next focus was to re-establish navigation to my next known waypoint; the ZZZ VOR. I had previously tuned the ZZZ VOR into the NAV1 and NAV2; so I had manual navigation and DME via NAV2. Since the GNS430 and secondary GTX330 appeared operable; I immediately squawked 7600 as I had been out of contact with ZZZ1 Center (which was on COM1) and had obviously deviated heading/altitude at the beginning of the incident a few moments earlier. Not knowing what was happening to cause these failures and what might be failing next; setting the squawk may at the very least alert Center that I am having a problem. I also needed a few moments to sort out which frequency I needed to be on; as at this point the stress level was high enough I could not remember the frequency. I had to retrieve the iPad which was still on the floor in order to look at the chart screen for the frequency. Once back in contact with ZZZ1 Center I described the situation as best I could: some kind of electrical and/or communication failure as most of my avionics were now off. I elected for a diversion to ZZZ; now about 17nm away; and worry about troubleshooting the problem on the ground rather in the air in IMC at night. I was given vectors for a visual approach and landed without further incident.Having time to analyze the situation; and noting after landing/parking that the Avionics 1 & 2 were able to be switch back on; I conclude that the root cause of the systems associated with Avionics Bus 1 failing was from the iPad mount falling off the windscreen and hitting the switch on the way down. In personal reflection; I can recognize the irony that simply reaching over to check the avionics switches would have likely resolved the issue. But; the totality of the circumstances I had been suddenly faced with: 'an unexpected flight attitude deviation following an otherwise innocuous distraction; an initial observation of having a GPS signal failure'. Normally a failure of the GNS530/430; even if the failure was a complete loss of the entire unit; would not have resulted in the loss of the autopilot modes. Typically any normal failure of the autopilot is also accompanied by an audible alert. I had no immediate indication that the autopilot was off until observing the aircraft starting a descending turn. This precipitated the human factor contribution to the scenario of dealing with an otherwise unexplainable loss of avionics and uncommanded attitude deviation and no indication to which trained emergency checklist actions would be a prudent course of action. Overall troubleshooting based on system knowledge is a higher level brain function and at the time I did not have the luxury of 'stepping back' to think what might be going wrong. All that to say; there are no checklists specifically for an avionics failure (such as the switch some how getting turned off) or even what to do if the GPS fails. The assumed reactions remain in the realm of pilot knowledge and ability to troubleshoot the problem in lieu of following a checklist... in all likelihood with the assumption that the autopilot is still functional. This isn't a suggestion that we make a new checklist item; but rather the addition of random failure modes such as this during training to either establish situational memory or reinforce what to do if you don't know what to do. Finally; the root culprit of the situation... the iPad mount. This has been an ongoing 'issue' that has been simply tolerated by Company pilots. It hasn't been reported likely because we didn't think it was a big problem; would have never imagined it would lead to any problem; or have not been explicitly told that it is a problem if it occurs. There is also the ongoing back and forth with pilots who do not like having the mount and will remove it from the windscreen. The result is the mount ends up on the floor; getting dirty and damaged to the point that many of the suction cups do not effectively stay on the windscreen. In fact; in talking with another co-worker I discovered that this exact scenario happened to him during an AM departure a few weeks earlier and had hit both Avionics 1 & 2 switches. Since he saw it (and had the benefit of being VFR during the day) he just turned the switches back on and remounted the iPad. It has been my observation the suction cups seem to most frequently fail when climbing into colder temperatures; but this is not always the case. At this point; I believe it is safe to say that the current mounting system does not work... either by nature of system or as a result of the poor care and handling it as received over the past year or so. I will have to admit; the iPad mount coming off is something that I have observed and didn't report... and frankly should have reported and made a big stink over sooner. But I am now: at this point I do not believe the current iPad mounting system to be either effective nor safe.,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

355,355,355,355,10711,Enroute from ZZZ to YKM last flight of the day.  Night conditions with smoke. Tower and Approach Control were closed. I was pilot flying.  Route was planned over V298 through DATVE intersection.  This route took us through a TFR due to fires northwest of Yakima.  Approaching DATVE; we got discretion to 11000 ft; and requested RNP RWY 9 starting at DATVE.  At first Seattle Center told us we may need to hold because of another airplane on another approach into Yakima; we told him we could do that; but he told us to do a right 360 and that we would be able to proceed inbound after that.  After making the turn we were told to track the approach inbound and were cleared down to 8500 ft; then 8100 ft.  Due to the TFR he couldn't clear us lower.  When he finally cleared us for the approach; we ended up really high but we elected to configure early and continue with the approach.  We had to use VS mode to descend because we could not get the VNAV linked being so high.  We protected the airplane with the altitude alerter and ALT SELECT for each segment.  When we cleared the smoke and could see the airport we were approaching YINUL and we noticed we were still quite high. At this point we were set up gear down and flaps 15 but I thought I had called for flaps 35.  We were not sure if we would be able to make it so we told Center we may need to come around for another approach.  A moment later we noticed the glidepath coming in so we elected to continue with a visual approach.  The controller re-cleared us for a visual and we switched to CTAF.  At some point we set the altitude alerter to field elevation and continued.  Thinking I was already at flaps 35 I called for below the line at the 1000 ft chime.  Right around the '500' call we got the aural warning 'TOO LOW - FLAPS' and I called for and executed a missed approach.  As we were climbing I elected to fly a visual left hand traffic pattern back to Runway 9 instead of the published missed approach procedure to avoid going back up into the smoke layer.  We set the alerter to 2600 ft and went around; but ended up climbing to about 4000 for extra safety margin.  We reactivated the approach for final approach guidance; turned base at about 3.5 miles and landed without incident on RWY 9. The flight from ZZZ to YKM is very quick.  Especially landing to the East.  I usually landed on 27 so was not as familiar with the approach to RWY 9 but we did note the high approach angle of 3.5 Deg.  And briefed it thoroughly.  The approach felt uncomfortably high; which led to us being distracted.  I was thinking about the potential missed approach and we missed the fact that the airplane was not fully configured for landing.  In retrospect we should have told ATC that we want to hold at DATVE until he could fully clear us for the approach once the other airplane landed. That would have given us enough time to get everything set and avoid distractions and time compression.  The other thing we could have done is requested vectors to the south and to start the approach from YKM VOR.  Or we could have set up for RWY 27 since the winds were almost a direct crosswind slightly favoring Runway 9 and under 10 kts.  The other thing I would do different next time at night is to fly the published missed approach procedure because of the terrain.  I felt comfortable with my knowledge of the terrain in Yakima; but flying the traffic pattern at night on the missed added another layer of risk that we didn't need at that point.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
356,356,356,356,6349,At FL220 while using the autopilot; I encountered moderate icing in stratocumulus clouds (-25 degrees) at cruise enroute to ZZZ. I had been in the icing conditions less than a minute; but the windshields were icing over despite windshield heat being ON. I asked and received clearance for a lower altitude. Concurrent with ATC's instructions; the DEICE BOOTS caution message illuminated on the CAS. The CAS message indicates a failure in deice boots inflation system; and since I was carrying a significant amount of ice; the message divided my attention from ATC's instructions. After determining the state of the boots; which appeared to be working; I saw that I had set 7000 in the altitude preselect; but did not recall doing so or acknowledging the action. I called ATC and asked them to confirm my assigned altitude of 7000. I heard him say 6000 and repeated that instruction back to him; then set the altitude preselect for 6000.I am now approaching my destination which has its ASOS NOTAMed out of service; but is transmitting weather info in the 'TEST' mode. I am looking at the ground where I believe my destination is and confirm that the ASOS is likely correct; 1/4 and VV100. My alternate is VFR and I am beginning to consider what changes I need to accommodate the new destination. Simultaneously; I get a TAS and a call from ATC telling me I was supposed to stop at 7000 and to climb. I saw a high-wing Cessna at my 10 o'clock and about a mile and probably at 6000. I was at about 6300 when I began climbing. There was no danger of collision; but certainly a loss of separation. I climbed back to 7000 and finished the flight without further incident.In analysis of what went wrong; I cannot be sure if I misheard the controller; or if or he misheard me; or if the wrong instruction was given. It also seemed like a controller change occurred; but I am not sure. Clearly I was distracted; but only by operationally necessary tasks (looking for ZZZ; troubleshooting the boots; assessing ice distribution; alternate preparations; etc.); and I had relaxed my attention with regard to the assigned altitude; but I was aware that I was approaching the level-off. To my knowledge the autopilot was properly set and would perform according; but obviously it was not set correctly. In the future; I will be sure to doubly sure to confirm instructions with ATC when I recognize that my workload is divided between navigating the aircraft and systems. I believe this situation was a result of several near simultaneous incidents in a single pilot cockpit causing divided attention that contributed to a missed altitude and loss of separation.,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

We were heavy enough that 230 KTS was barely above green dot speed (min safe speed for an Airbus). Encountered up to moderate wake turbulence. Significant enough that I couldn't maintain altitude let alone climb and slightly descend at times to maintain a safe speed. No way to climb above it based the slow climb speed and being a heavy A321. Continued off and on until almost BUBBY waypoint. Eventually asked for a slight left upwind heading but it helped only a little.ATC clearing us to takeoff too close behind a B757. 230 KT demanded climb speed. We didn't demand a takeoff delay behind the B757 even though both aircraft are 'large'. We also didn't demand a higher climb speed.A B757 is still a hazardous aircraft to take off behind. Even our ADS-B system labels them as a 'high vortex' wake as opposed to simply 'large'. The FAA needs to re institute heavy wake separation behind B757s instead of cramming in more departures by deciding a large behind a 757 doesn't need any wake separation. I will be asking for at least 30 sec after liftoff or at least 1 minute after brake release when taking off behind a B757 from here on.

The Captain read the QRH; we sent in the Fault Reporting Manual code; and did not receive the normal and automated response from maintenance (the ACARS system went down). During final approach to ZZZ and after being fully configured for runway XYR; the airspeed maximum and minimum maneuver speed amber and red and black were all visible on the PFD. As I understand; the amber maximum maneuver speed bar should not be visible after being fully configured for landing. Our indications seemed very abnormal. The safe speed window was very narrow and fluctuating because of the turbulence.As we descended on final; the ride was moderate turbulence. The aircraft in front of us performed a go around then reported plus and minus 30 knots wind shear. We were also experiencing airspeed fluctuations and made the decision to go around (GPWS INOP). During the go around maneuver; the flaps would not retract and the safe speed margin was extraordinarily narrow. The moderate turbulence continued. It was difficult to maintain a safe airspeed and climb rate. I focused on flying the airplane.During the event; the Captain [advised ATC] and we continued our climb eastbound; meanwhile requesting higher altitudes with ATC. After knowing we were at a safe altitude with the aircraft in positive control IMC; the Captain returned the flap selector to flaps 30 and then we were finally successful with flap retraction.

361,361,361,361,7956,The purpose of this ASAP is to highlight a safety issue with SoCal during arrivals into LAX.  We all laugh; and expect changes in the arrival procedures into LAX.  This event illustrates the danger that we are faced with.  On our arrival; we had planned a 280 KT descent to comply with speed at KONZL.  During our descent; we were slowed from 280 to 260.  During a descent; it is difficult to slow and stay on descent path.  Our aircraft was heavy and not slowing very well.  After passing KONZL; we were given descent via; but sped up to 280 again.  Another programming requirement while complying with the various altitudes.  Shortly thereafter; we were slowed to 250.  After jumping through hoops with the FMC programming; were slowed to 230; then 170.  All with a 30 KT tailwind; attempting to maintain altitude restrictions as well as put the aircraft in a position to be stabilized on final approach.  During the arrival; the speed changes were so drastic; I went to the old school method of stepping to the next altitude and turned off the automation.  I can appreciate automation; but when confronted with the rapid speed change requirements on an LNAV/VNAV arrival; the task at hand becomes quite daunting and even confusing.  We were tired; but we both recognized the futility of trying to make automation work; so we reverted to old school procedures.  My point here is not to show my superiority; but to point out that the numerous speed changes we are frequently faced with are distracting and possibly dangerous.  I don't want to be the Crew that is too absorbed in making the automation work that they forget to fly the aircraft.  SoCal needs to pick a speed and go with it.  Multiple speed changes on an arrival lead to non-compliance with chart restrictions and could lead to a dangerous flight condition.  The situation doesn't sound that bad here on paper; but it is a concern; and I think that if we don't speak up to ATC; then to them it is tacit approval to continue with this dangerous practice.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
362,362,362,362,2442,This trip is actually the continuation of Aircraft X; on date; the day following our weather divert to ZZZ.While beginning our descent on the ZZZZZ 4 arrival into ZZZ1 the FO (PF) deployed the speed brakes to approx 50% in order to comply with the altitude restriction. When the FO stowed the Speed Brakes the aircraft abruptly rolled 35 degrees to the left. The autopilot had difficulty controlling the aircraft so we disconnected and FO flew manually. The FO quickly and accurately corrected the left-roll tendency with right ailerons; leveled the wings and continued the arrival. Simultaneously to these events the SPOILERS EICAS illuminated. We slowed to 250 KIAS to minimize the left-roll tendency and informed ATC. We decided to have the FO continue to fly and handle radios while I ran the non-normal checklist; coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance and ran the TEST with the Lead Flight Attendant. After finishing the SPOILERS EICAS checklist and the other coordination was complete it was determined that some of the spoilers on the left wing remained in the UP position and would not stow. I opted to request priority handling and requested the ILS to Runway XXC with a long; 20 mile final; which ATC coordinated. We then gradually slowed and configured the aircraft; determining the aircraft controllability with each configuration change. Once final landing configuration (Flaps 30) and target speed were established the aircraft continued the left-roll tendency but was manageable. The FO accurately noted that at target speed the speed tape showed little margin above stick shaker activation; so we opted to add 10 Knots to our target speed. I believe this was due to the spoilers still extended on the left wing. The remainder of the approach and landing being uneventful as the FO made an excellent landing. I took the aircraft on the rollout and we met the responding Emergency personnel.

There was a solid line of weather East to West in my sector. The military flight was at FL270 and asked for tops reports. I told him I did not have any. They requested FL390 neg. RVSM. There was no traffic so I climbed them to FL390. The flight declared minimum fuel. At the end of my briefing the flight requested a break up. He wanted to split with two flights due to weather.  Aircraft X was told to maintain FL360 and Aircraft Y was told to maintain FL370. We were able to get 3 XYZ Aircraft tracks up but only were able to tag up 2 XYZ Aircraft tracks due to additional requests and call sign mix ups.

South of the localizer and the PRINO intersection; Approach Control asked us if we had the runway in sight. After confirming we had the runway in sight; Approach cleared us for the visual. We initially went direct to SHAND and then direct RELIN. We had initially set 4;900 feet into the altitude alert and started a descent; I was expecting to level off at this altitude but realized that this was not going to occur. I verbally stated that we should level off at 4;900 feet but with the open descent mode selected we continued to descend. It was then that the autopilot was disengaged and a climb was initiated. At some point about that time we received a GPWS warning. We continued to climb and the warning stopped. Factors:1. Is was approximately XA:00 for us and the second leg with an origination in [the east]. This was the backside of the clock for us and fatigue was a big factor.2.

The crew discussed letting the system auto change to green needles to complete the approach. Shortly after that SLC Approach Control gave us a vector of 120 degrees to intercept the final approach and maintain 7;500 feet until established. Heading was selected. I should have selected green needles at that time. But I did not and was waiting for the system to intercept the inbound course forgetting heading mode was selected.When we went through the approach course; I was trying to figure out why instead of making an immediate correction. I started to make a correction at about the same time SLC Approach gave us an immediate heading change to the southwest and a climb; due to high terrain to the east of our position. On our new heading we were cleared to intercept the final approach course followed by an uneventful approach and landing.I should make sure trying to use automation does not interfere with proper control of the aircraft.

371,371,371,371,10400,Prior to departing YUL; we needed de-icing and anti-icing of the aircraft. We taxied to the de-ice area; configured; and communicated our needs to the ice-man. We asked for a full body Type 1 and Wings; Tail; [and] Top of fuselage only Type 4. The entire process was normal. We taxied to Runway 24R for departure and performed the requisite 60% N1 run-up for 20 seconds and waited the 3 minutes prior to turning the packs on. Since icing conditions were prevalent at the time of takeoff; we used the Bleeds closed; Wings and Cowl Anti-Ice On configuration. The takeoff roll was normal; and about 3 seconds after rotating and liftoff; the cockpit started to fill with smoke. We quickly ascertained it was the Type 4 fluid running down the fuselage into the APU inlet; and being burned and discharged thru the packs into the cockpit. The intensity was fairly great initially; but quickly dissipated. By the time we climbed to 1;000 ft. AGL and started the climb sequence; the condition had abated entirely. After the post takeoff checks were completed and we were safely climbing; I contacted the FA to ask if anything unusual had occurred in the cabin since takeoff. The FA said all was OK in the cabin; and no anomaly occurred; and all the passengers were fine. Apparently the anti-ice fluid smoke only infiltrated the cockpit. The root cause of this event is the change mandated by Transport Canada that we anti-ice the fuselage of the CRJ-200 if the Wings and Tail require anti-icing prior to takeoff. Contributing factors could be excessive amounts of Type 4 fluid applied to the airframe; but we would not be able to discern that from our vantage point.The current Flight Operations Bulleting in circulation outlines that we do not takeoff unpressurized after de-icing; anti-icing unless performance limitations require that configuration. We could institute unpressurized takeoffs in Canada; during icing conditions; and after being anti-iced on the fuselage to prevent smoke entering the cockpit; and or cabin.

374,374,374,374,8323,Enroute to SAT during descent; we encountered turbulence bordering on severe. The only turbulence forecast for route of flight was for the [departure] area. As part of preflight briefing; I instructed the flight attendants that while previous pilots had informed us there was a smooth ride into [departure airport]; they should remain seated until I gave them a call. I also used [weather forecast] to brief the FO on weather along our route of flight. [Weather forecast] displayed the briefed turbulence over [departure airport]; some significant weather well east of our route of flight and a possible (very thin line) of rain showers around Abilene.We let the flight attendants up at FL 330. Enroute to SAT north of Abilene; I switched the radar on (we could see the storms off to the east (75 miles). During the descent passing FL 290; I observed ground obscuration of indeterminate height and we asked ATC about the rides in the descent. We were told there were no adverse reports. Believing the obscuration to be associated with the low ceiling I told the flight attendants we were concerned about the lower clouds and that we were at FL270 and 109 miles from the airport and that they should clean the cabin and sit down and we would ding them again at 10;000 feet for the 10;000 feet announcement. Passing 250 we began to encounter clouds and light turbulence; so I called the flight attendants again; apologized told them they better take their seats and we would try to find time to clean the cabin on the other side of the clouds. The FA A announced 'flight attendants take your seats'.We leveled at 240; for a short period the ride smoothed out then we were cleared to STONEWALL ONE at 10;000 feet. At this time descent speed was set for 280 and I was maintaining approximately 270 knots. We were also still using the radar adjusting angle for elevation with radar now set to the 80 mile scale. Passing FL190 we observed more clouds along our route of flight and now small cells started to pop up on our radar with several 10 miles left and one cell four miles right of our route of flight. We asked ATC for a deviation left of course of five degrees; radar scale was now reduced to 20-40 miles with angle between minus .5 to plus1; passing 17;000 feet a very small cell (1/4 mile in diameter) popped up on radar directly in front of our route of flight and 1/2 mile ahead. Entering the clouds we encountered a couple of bumps of light turbulence followed a few seconds later by moderate and occasional turbulence bordering on severe lasting five to eight seconds.We exited the cloud and I called to ask the flight attendants if everything was okay. The B and C informed me that they were not okay and that the C had hit her head and they were assessing the situation. We informed ATC of the turbulence waited two minutes then asked the flight attendants about their condition. They informed us they were okay (with the head bump) we asked if there were any issues/injuries in the cabin and were again informed no. We asked if they wanted to have the paramedics meet them (the flight attendants) and were informed no. We spoke with the flight attendants one more time during the descent prior to 10;000 feet. Subsequently; the flight attendants notified us that they would like the paramedics to meet them at the aircraft. The paramedics evaluated the B and C flight attendants and determined that an immediate hospital visit was not required.

I contacted the Tower and informed them I had an electrical problem and was requesting to return for landing. I was in a little too tight to land on runway XX which was the runway I had just taken off from so I requested to enter a left downwind for runway XY as there was basically no winds.

378,378,378,378,10414,ATC slowed us to 210; 190; then 170 KIAS; and then vectored us at 4;000 feet on a base leg for the visual approach to [Runway] 34L. As we rolled out on our base leg vector heading; a B737 was 3 miles ahead; at our 11 o' clock and about 1;000 feet above. ATC had us follow that traffic; cleared visual approach 34L. In the flight deck; we discussed the options to increase our separation; and reduce wake turbulence; behind the preceding aircraft. We decided to make the turn as square as possible without blowing through the localizer (visual approaches were also being conducted on the parallel Runway 34R); and stay one dot high on the glide path. We made a square turn to intercept the localizer; but the aircraft was still only about three miles ahead. As we began our descent below 4;000 feet; we encountered wake turbulence. Significant control inputs were required to correct for the resulting 'Dutch Roll' motion (wing lateral roll/rocking motion coupled with tail wag directional motion). The turbulence lasted for approximately 15-20 seconds; as we raised our glide path to about one dot above; which allowed us to exit the wake turbulence by about 3;000 feet. We maintained a higher glide path for the rest of the approach; keeping us clear of the turbulence for the rest of the visual approach to landing. Although the aircraft remained under positive control throughout the turbulence encounter; and within stable visual approach parameters for the entire approach; the motion was very uncomfortable and noticeable to everyone on board. Checking with our flight attendants after the event; no one in the cabin was injured; but a lot of passengers were understandably giving the flight attendants weird looks. Both flight attendants had recognized the motion as wake turbulence as it was occurring.A busy airport can present challenges with aircraft separation and wake turbulence avoidance; especially on visual approaches. ATC requested a specific speed for sequencing; presumably to fit us in behind the B737 and in front of other arrivals. Under other circumstances where the preceding aircraft is at the same altitude or lower; three miles of spacing behind a B737 may not have resulted in wake turbulence. It is a larger aircraft but not a heavy. However; in this case; the higher altitude of the preceding aircraft guaranteed that we would start out below its glide path; at least until we could cross its glide path to become established on a higher glide path. Therefore; the spacing really was not adequate for wake turbulence avoidance; since additional time should have been allowed for the vortices to dissipate prior to our crossing of the preceding aircraft's glide path (and those vortices). We suspect ATC was not accounting for the higher altitude of the preceding aircraft when they stacked us in so close behind the preceding aircraft. In the future; we will be more assertive and ask ATC for a lower speed; or for delay vectors; prior to the visual approach; even if that means ATC has to work harder to fit us in somewhere else in the sequence.,"[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

An issue affected our ability to communicate with ATC (transmitting) and each other (via the intercom). We were able to accept a visual approach clearance with the TRACON about 10 miles from the airport at an altitude of roughly 3000'. However; at this point; we lost the transmit function on both our COMs and it remained unclear whether ATC could hear us. When we both pressed the PTT; the radios went silent despite the 'TX' being present on the radio page of the MCDU. We also could not hear each other over the intercom; but we could hear ATC without issue. The approach controller made several attempts to hand us off to tower; but apparently never heard us. We slowed the aircraft for a visual approach to [the] runway as we continued to resolve the issue. As we configured for landing; we attempted to use the hand mics; as well as; all available PTTs and COM 2 to regain communication. We also reset our O2 mask mics; but the problem continued. The tower controller began calling us as we crossed over the FAF. After establishing the approach; we continued our attempts to reach ATC and Fist Officer (FO) alertly began squawking 7600.The tower made several attempts to clear us to land and we eventually acknowledged our landing clearance by flashing our landing lights and pressing IDENT. Again; this all happened within 10 miles of the airport and left us little time to problem solve. Adding to the frustration; our inability to hear each other made it difficult to complete normal approach calls. We accomplished the Landing Checklist as I established the aircraft on a stabilized approach. However; in our attempts to troubleshoot the communication issue; I neglected to notice the flap handle sitting between 4 and 5. At roughly 700'; we received an aural alert 'TOO LOW; FLAPS'. Our FO quickly tapped the flap handle into the detent and the flaps traveled to the 5 position. After a brief discussion; I elected to continue the approach because we could not communicate a go around to ATC and I was unclear how we would explain our situation as we attempted to return to the field. Additionally; the aircraft was established on speed/profile for a night; visual approach to a long runway in VMC conditions and would ultimately land with the flaps at 5. After a normal/routine landing; we cleared the runway and ATC could now make out some of our transmissions. I still had difficulty hearing via the intercom or when the mic was keyed; but we complied with our taxi instructions and canceled the 7600 squawk at the tower's request. After shutting down at the gate and completing the Parking Checklist; we made several radio checks on COM1 and COM2 using each of the available mics. At this point; the issue had completely disappeared and we were able to communicate clearly using each PTT and mic. I still entered the discrepancy in the aircraft logbook and contacted dispatch and maintenance control to make them aware of the problem.As a side note; Tower informed us that we were the second [company] aircraft to arrive this evening with radio issues.The best way to prevent these fixation issues would be to remain vigilant and follow SOP. I personally neglected the golden rule of aviating before communicating as I attempted to reestablish COMs during a critical stage of flight. Had I cross checked the flap indication with the handle position during the Landing Checklist we could have immediately remedied the situation.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
380,380,380,380,8276,Leading a 4-ship [formation flight] through the Washington; DC SFRA. Between wake turbulence and concern for birds the flight's altitude dropped below that prescribed in the briefing. Speed issues also were challenging due to the vectoring and instructions from Potomac TRACON. These type of aircraft; [are] a sleek and slick platform that does not have speed brakes. Further; rapid and random power changes are not recommended for engine safety and to maintain the integrity of the formation. Power reductions need to be done gradually for engine care and operation and they need to be done even more carefully when managing a formation flight where three other aircraft are all reading off of the lead airplane.  In short; consideration of the safety of the formation priority number one; making rapid changes would have been difficult and unsafe. The spacing and recommended speed changes made by TRACON required our 4-ship [formation] to encounter wake turbulence behind [other aircraft] prior to our entering of the airspace.  The altitude factors were not only wake-turbulence; specifically hawks and other bird life operating at and above the briefing altitude and the lead pilot made a command decision to be at the safe or lower than briefed altitude. Our 4-ship encountered numerous potential bird strikes at the briefing altitude on the inbound portion of the flight.  Safe operation of the flight required the lead pilot to descend below briefed minimum to avoid wake turbulence and wildlife. The problem was further enhanced by known photo ship aircraft; creating additional safety concerns in keeping with safe distance. Judgment was used in keeping ample speed and safe altitude to maintain flight path. At no time was the flight path deviated; but altitude and speed were used to maintain safe flight operations; formation integrity and safe flight.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

384,384,384,384,9809,I was on an IFR flight plan that I filed from the air. At the time I was deciding between landing at a local airport that was marginal VFR but had a stationary thunderstorm within 20 NM of the airport; or continuing up 200 NM north of my position to an airport that was familiar but not ultimately very close to my final destination. There was a large stationary front with a big radar return over most of geographic area; ranging at least in 200-250 NM in diameter. It was slow moving with mostly green radar returns along my preferred destination. I chose an airport that was behind any radar return and had high ceilings. I had plenty of fuel (5 hours) and the weather was reporting IFR; but the ceilings were staying well within my comfort zone. I usually prefer not to fly approaches unless I have a 1000 ft ceiling; for safety. But the METAR was reporting 900 feet broken and overcast at my destination which is within my personal limits so I continued on to my destination. I was watching the huge cell move to the north and east in a slow direction (away from my destination). As I continued to watch the radar as I got closer to my destination; I continued to scan and listen to all ATIS/AWOS/ASOS reports in a 50 NM area as the stations came into listening distance. I took a screenshot of all the METARs of airports within 50 NM of my landing; and of the 9 that showed up; 4 were marginal VFR; 4 were IFR with ceilings of 800/900 and one was low IFR about 60 NM to the west. I have some familiarity with the airport and location I was flying to. However; I picked this particular destination because of a GPS approach and because of the higher ceilings at this airport than the surrounding areas. In truth; this destination was still about 1 hour flying time than the destination I really wanted. But; it was at the tail end of the radar returns which had moved away by the time I was ready to fly the approach. I was overly concerned about the radar return (which was all colored Green; not yellow or red) and took little interest in the satellite picture. In my opinion; I safely chose the best field and weather conditions as possible that were legal. As a CFI/Commercial pilot that flies mainly for pleasure; I was not in a hurry that day nor did I need to make any destination (as I obviously was self-deviating to a better airport than my home airport). However; I believe I was lulled into a false sense of security by continually trying to get new information from my radar/ASOS/ATIS and other tools.The airport I chose did not have its own METAR/AWOS. Instead; I was using the AWOS for a field approximately 8 NM west away as per the instrument approach chart. Minutes from final approach; the ASOS reported 900 ft ceilings; 5 sm visibility; and no rain. I made one last final scan of all weather and noticed a 5 sm and 'VFR clear' on foreflight from an airport just a few miles to the south. With good weather in hand and confidence in my abilities to make the approach safely; I proceeded to do the approach. As I descended to the final approach fix I noticed that the clouds were broken in areas. I could hazily see in front of me; but clearly saw the ground off the left wing in patches and holes; and off the right wing with a little less clarity. I was able to see and make out distinct buildings; farm houses; and roads. This all aligned with my map overlay of the approach I was flying. I descended down to the approach. The ceiling at the time of the final approach; and up to 3 hours later; was reported as 900 ft overcast and 5 sm. I flew down to the final approach fix and descended to the circling approach minimums. I felt that these minimums gave me a clear safety margin and time to execute a go-around while I would proceed to do the missed approach procedure if necessary. I positively identified that I had broken out of the clouds. Ahead of me was still surrounded in the very shallowest of white; but to the left and the right I had broken out at700 feet AGL. It was thin enough in front of me that it felt more like a haze than still being in IMC. I had not yet reached the decision point but was beginning to faintly see the plowed field of the airport.Moments later; I clearly saw the runway environment and landed safely. I saw the numbers of the runway through the haze and positively established the runway environment. Factors that added to my desire to write an ASRS report were few. In retrospect; I reviewed the NOTAMs for one of the METAR stations that I was using as a secondary source for the ceilings of the flight. Many hours later that evening; I saw that every airport within a 100 NM radius was 400 ft overcast and less than 1 SM visibility EXCEPT for one airport. This particular METAR was reporting the low visibility; but as 'VFR.' It was only hours after the fact that I had landed safely on the ground that I realized that this particular ground station had been NOTAMd out as being unreliable on cloud clearances. It wasn't my primary weather reporting reference; nor was it the one that was called for in the instrument approach; but it put in further doubt about how 100% confident I had been in my information. In a zoomed out view; I was looking at weather radar/thunderstorm returns. By getting a grand overview of the flight category and type of approaches; I chose the airport with the highest ceilings and best surrounding weather. The airport I chose had no individual ASOS; and was reliant on the weather from 8 nm over. However; I didn't immediately know that when I picked the airport; and the ceilings were remaining high enough that it didn't concern me. I wanted to fill out a safety report so maybe other pilots wouldn't see erroneous metar information on their weather information. Even though it had been NOTAM'd out; it was still 'present' on my devices and causes conflicting information. I think this is a human factors and perceptions safety issue. While there was no violation of cloud clearances or minimums because of the bad METAR; it still has had a lasting effect on my perceived 'correctness' of my information and how the large scope of information was tainted by one bad METAR. In the future; I will pick 4 METARs. One north; south; west; and east of my IFR destination and ensure that they are reporting correctly and not NOTAM'd out before trusting my information to them.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

387,387,387,387,8056,We departed...on time and headed to [destination]. The current METAR reported winds 190/14 Gusting 26Kts; 9SM; OVC 800 ft.

He had reported wind shear with a +/- 25kts. After adding the wind shear escape maneuver to our brief and changing our configuration to land with Flaps 22; we continued with our approach. Around 1;000ft; we started to fly through some turbulence and gusts of wind. By 500 ft; the gust had intensified and it felt like going through wind shear but the plane did not give a warning. Around 400ft; we executed a normal go-around and with max thrust and flaps 9. We got very little climb and set off the GPWS momentarily. We climbed to 2000 ft and reviewed the flight plan to make sure we had enough fuel to come back for a second approach; which we did. After being cleared for the second approach and on final; Tower gave us an update on the weather and it had deteriorated; putting the ceiling at 200ft (below our minimums).

388,388,388,388,9375,On final as the airspeed bled off to Vap (Approach Speed); the PM noted that green dot was above Vap. I observed that green dot was approximately eight knots above Vap. I verified that the aircraft was configured correctly and requested that the PF add at least ten knots to bug speed. We briefly discussed the large amount of fuel on board (tankering) and the PF opined that there must have been a calculation error. Having increased airspeed to the new bug speed; we determined that we were stabilized and continued [the] approach. I failed to recognize that this constituted a misconfiguration and should have required that I initiate a go-around in order to rework the landing data. We landed uneventfully.We debriefed at the gate and concluded that there was a calculation error in the landing data resulting in an incorrect landing weight and inappropriate landing V-speeds. We attempted to determine whether this was caused by an automation error or a 'fuel on board' data entry error but the ACARS landing data printout did not reveal what 'fuel on board' weight had been used in the landing calculation. In examining the ACARS takeoff data and landing data after the fact; the ACARS landing weight was 61;030 lbs and the ACARS zero fuel weight was 121 lbs less at 60;909 lbs. The fuel on board at the gate was 11;700 lbs.The weight disparity in the landing calculation appears to have been on the order of 11;770 lbs; which is very close to the fuel on board we observed at the gate (11;700 lbs). The landing init page was automatically cleared on landing; and looking at the landing init page in flight may not capture the actual numbers that were sent via ACARS when requesting landing data. Including the 'fuel on board' information on the ACARS landing data printout could be useful as a cross check. Simply printing the calculated landing weight; as is done now; may require mental calculation to discern a disparity whereas a direct reading 'fuel on board' number printed on the ACARS printout that correlates directly to the fuel quantity displayed on EICAS could help to alert flight crews to such a disparity. Another 'reality check' could be added to the automation when the disparity between entered fuel on board and release landing fuel exceeds a certain value; or when landing fuel on board is less than a minimum value as happens on the EICAS with yellow and magenta coding.As it was; I failed to monitor the fuel on board data entry when the PM requested landing data; exercising the expectation bias that he had done the due diligence since he had not requested that I verify his data entries before sending. I do not know whether the PM even made an entry to override the FMS value; or whether the FMS-supplied entry was zero or blank; so it is possible that this is also an automation error; especially since the new ACARS Rev.

389,389,389,389,10672,During an ILS approach to Runway XXR; the PF failed to slow early enough on final approach. PF configured later than desired considering the situation (fast due to earlier ATC request) resulting in the aircraft becoming high on glide path while slowing to configure for landing. PF needed to use a sink rate higher than desired to return to glide slope. We met the published parameters at all of our approach gates; but the first portion of the approach was unstable. We landed safely on XXR and proceeded routinely to the gate.The main lesson learned was to slow earlier on final approach to allow a more stable approach. We accomplished all checklists and procedures and landed safely; but the crew would have been more able to look for potential threats if the PF had flown a more stable approach during the first portion of the approach.

390,390,390,390,3509,We were originally scheduled to operate two legs. Upon arrival in the intermediate leg we were informed of an additional leg and then we would continue to our final destination. I looked at the weather at our final destination and it was showing 2;200 scattered with 8 miles visibility. I knew the main runway and ILS were out on 35L/17R so I assumed we would be landing on 35R with the prevailing crosswind. It was a quick flight up to the intermediate so we were working hard to get set up for the VOR 32 circle to 35R. The non precision approach briefing guide is a bit wordy so we had to keep the pace up doing the brief. We were halfway through the brief when we were notified that the Tower had turned the airport around to use 17L. Since we are limited to maintain 1;000-3 on circling approaches and I haven't been to this in a few years I decided that it would be safer for us to just do the straight in NDB 17L instead of circling around in unfamiliar terrain. We were cleared to the NDB and got ready for the approach and did a briefing. There was no NDB in the FMC database so I put the beacon on the legs page with the runway underneath it for graphical reference. Things were looking pretty good even though this was a last minute change of runways by ATC. As we were getting ready for our final intercept for the approach course I tried unsuccessfully to get a good ident on the NDB. My First Officer queried me about the flag on the NDB and I told him I was trying to get an ident. I got nothing. I told my First Officer to monitor the number 1 radio and I switched over to Tower and asked them if they had a green light on the NDB. The Controller said that it was unmonitored and has been on/off working (nothing in the NOTAMs about that). I told my First Officer that we would be unable to do the approach and told ATC that as well. I requested to ATC that we would like to try and get in visually and would need a vector and lower altitude. ATC complied. We configured for landing and waited at 2;200 MSL (approximately 1;700 AGL) for sight of the runway. We saw the runway at about 5 miles and were cleared to do the visual to 17L and to switch to Tower. My First Officer started the descent for the runway. We were high on the PAPI and about 10 KTS fast. I told my First Officer to do some S turns to help him lose some altitude. The runway change ended up giving us a bit of a tailwind on the approach. We had to hold approximately 1;200 FPM to get down to the correct path and maintained plus 10 KTS over target speed. At no time did I feel that what we were doing was unsafe or unstable but we were definitely close to being unstable. I felt that the inputs my First Officer was doing were correct during the approach and landed without incident. I do understand the requirements for a stable approach and I have always thought of them as a circle that you never want to be out of nor should you - otherwise perform a go around. My personal circle is much smaller and I demand of myself tighter tolerances. The reason I am writing this report is that even though I believe we met the stabilized criteria for the visual approach we were right on the borderline of being stabilized. I'm not sure what the FOQA data uses to submit data if there is a stabilized exceedances but I know we were close to it. In retrospect we should have done the VOR 32 and circled for 17L per the FOM minimums for circling. I still think that we salvaged a tight situation that the failed NDB put us in but I'm still not happy that it was an approach that I felt was safe however poorly executed.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
391,391,391,391,1459,On approach to BWI at night while on an IFR flight plan; but in VFR conditions; I had difficulty following ATC requested headings and I missed the intercept for the ILS. At the time my new GPS (Garmin 650) self-dimmed to such a low level that it could not be seen. I could not figure out how to make it brighter and readable. At the same time the airspeed indicator and directional gyro were also poorly lighted despite the fact that I had the panel lighting turned up to maximum. I used a flashlight to light those two instruments while I was flying the plane. The original plan was to land at Carroll County Airport (DMW); but due to very bad weather there; at the last moment; I made a choice to land at BWI. I was also experiencing at times severe wake turbulence. Next time I should make sure that these instruments and the GPS are well lighted. Also; I waited in the decision to divert; and once I did so I was immediately exposed to an extremely busy ATC environment with no time to prepare or find the approach in my back-up paper approach plates. I was way too busy; and overwhelmed. Next time the decision to divert will be made further out and I will prepare for the approach way ahead of time. I will practice my instrument approaches more and practice landing at busy airports. Also it probably would have been much better to divert to a much less busy major GA airport such as Martin State Airport (MTN).,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Having left MIA just a few hours ago with numerous showers around I called to question this with the Dispatcher. He said the weather was dissipating and should be fine for our arrival with just a few storms en route over the mid-Atlantic. When we were on the descent into MIA the radar began to show a large storm over FLL with LTICCG (lightning in cloud and cloud to ground). We were vectored for an ILS approach to 08R. The weather was building rapidly and extending to the MIA airport. We heard a report of a 15 KT loss by another flight that had just landed 08R. I instructed the First Officer to tell the Tower we would need Runway 09; longer; full ILS minimums; and no report of wind shear for that runway. We were in a position of minimum fuel if a go-around and divert would be necessary due not having a filed alternate and the corresponding fuel. FLL the closest airport was not an option due to the storm over MIA-FLL. We checked with the Tower and the runway conditions appeared dry to them and the visibility at the surface was still 10 SM.

394,394,394,394,6544,This report is for the dangerous situation of inadvertently approaching an airport in mountainous terrain. at night at too low of a height above the airport.This issue happened because I did not crosscheck information provided by the Garmin GTN 625 Navigator for VNAV profile with airport information.  The button sequencing on the GTN 'zeroed out' the 1;000ft AGL offset I programed into the VNAV feature.  This appears to occur with all GTN 6xx/7xx navigators.I was flying a personal flight to SAF.  I knew that I would be arriving at night; and planned to approach from the Albuquerque area to avoid terrain.  In order to have a safe approach to the airport; I setup VNAV in my GPS Navigator; a Garmin GTN 625.  I used the VNAV feature to give a 3 degree glide path to a point 1 mile from the airport at 1;000ft AGL.In setting up the VNAV; for altitude I entered a value of 1;000ft; then hit the MSL/AGL soft key to enable AGL.When I reviewed the added point VNAV waypoint in the flight plan on the GTN; it autofilled a crossing altitude of 6;349ft MSL.

395,395,395,395,9739,I was giving takeoff and landing dual instruction in my Pitts and we departed the runway and ground looped the aircraft. We were using a runway that is 4500' long and 75' wide asphalt surface. The winds were out of the north at less than 5 kts (my estimate). The student and I had flown together previously many times about two years earlier when he was wanting to buy a Pitts and get a tailwheel endorsement. His Pitts was being rebuilt and was expected to be returned to him in a couple of weeks. He wanted to get some refresher training before he got in his single seat Pitts alone. We completed a flight staying (0.6 hours) in the pattern focusing on takeoffs and landings. We debriefed the first flight; rested an hour or so then loaded up for another flight in the pattern doing takeoffs and landings. The landing preceding the ground loop resulted in a go around initiated and flown by me due a poor landing rollout by the student. The final landing approach and touchdown were uneventful but the student began drifting to the right and did not respond to verbal commands to correct the situation. I assumed control of the aircraft and verbally announced this to the student per our briefed procedure. I believe the student unwittingly applied right rudder then right brake and I could not overcome his panicked application of rudder and brake before departing the runway at about a 30-45 degree angle. The aircraft ground looped at a slow speed in the grass. The left lower wing contacted the ground and the tailwheel broke off. I taxied the aircraft out of the grass and to the ramp area. I did not realized the tailwheel had sheared off but thought the left tire wheel assembly was damaged and made the taxiing difficult. I have been giving dual in Pitts aircraft for years and have never experienced an unrecoverable landing. I believe the students panicked and possible unknowing application of right rudder/brake led to the runway departure and subsequent ground loop. While I emphasize positive transfer of control and accidental application of brake when feet are on the rudder during every preflight brief I will highlight it more. The proximity of the rudder bar and brake is such that accidental application of brake is not uncommon while intending to apply rudder only. I believe the student inadvertently applied right brake and did not respond to the transfer of control command by removing his feet entirely from the rudder pedal. I was not able to overcome his application of the brake and keep the aircraft on the runway and avoid a ground loop.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
396,396,396,396,5561,During descent and arrival to APC airport while talking to Oakland center we were approximately 14 miles from the airport. We advised Oakland that we had the airport in sight. We were south and slightly west of the airport at this point. We had briefed the visual approach to runway 18R. We were expecting a right downwind to runway 18R as that was the most expeditious way for us to reach the airport. This was also expected due to the rising terrain that we could see east of the Napa airport. We were cleared by Oakland for the visual approach and we began our decent from 4000 feet to 1500 feet. We were handed over to Napa tower. We were instructed by the tower to remain south of the airport and to expect a left downwind to runway 18R. We complied with those instructions. As we were turning downwind; still cleared for the visual approach we were told to extend our downwind. We immediately noticed the rising terrain in front of us. We were advised by the tower of a low altitude alert and to check our altimeter. We chose to climb to 2000 feet to top the 1st ridge of hills in front of us. We also received a GPWS terrain caution warning during the climb to this new altitude. As we leveled off at 2000 feet we could see a second ridge that was higher in altitude in front of us. We were advised to report a departing aircraft in sight. However; the departure end of the runway was well behind us. We were advised to extend our downwind and the tower would call our base turn. At this time we were given a second low altitude alert by the tower. We chose to climb to 3000 feet. We were advised to turn base. We began descending for the airport at this point and we were advised of a third low altitude alert. We began a stable approach to the runway centered on the VASI. We landed without incident. It seems unclear to the tower the amount of space required by a jet to fly a left downwind approach to this runway at this airport. I am not sure how the approach could be flown in a stable manner without triggering a low altitude alert by the tower.

Almost immediately the aircraft started oscillating in pitch in response to the erratic glide slope. I made a comment to my First Officer that he was going to have to kick the autopilot off and hand fly the aircraft as the autopilot was not doing an adequate job. FO disconnected the autopilot and began hand flying. Everything at first appeared normal. Finally; he made the comment to me that 'something was not right; it was taking almost 1500 FPM to stay on the glide path.'

400,400,400,400,9044,Thirty minutes after a VIP TFR ended at a Class-C airport; I was cleared to land while on an ILS approach in IMC. A few miles from the airport; I emerged into marginal VFR conditions. During my flight; I received no traffic advisories to advise of a helicopter operating near and above runways. Before my flight; in a telephone briefing from FSS; I was read a list of NOTAMs at my destination; and these did not include any that warned of helicopter operations. As I touched down on the runway; I heard the Tower advise a Cessna; which was number two for landing behind me; to go around. At the same time; my Skywatch traffic surveillance avionics (similar to TCAS) called out 'traffic! traffic!' I discovered the problem by looking over my left shoulder; where I was surprised to see a military helicopter flying parallel to me at approximately 100 AGL and 300 FT from the runway centerline. The helicopter was faster than me as I was landing at less than 80 KTS; and it overtook me as I slowed down on the runway. The helicopter continued circling the runway vicinity at low altitude for at least another fifteen minutes. Occasionally I heard Tower or Ground make calls to '[X] Helicopter;' but I never heard any warnings given to traffic of the conflict that the helicopter posed. I believe the helicopter's operations endangered my safety by presenting a significant hazard to traffic.Contributing factors include: a lack of a NOTAM; a lack of an ATC advisory to alert inbound pilots to the presence of the helicopter; and marginal VFR conditions that made it impossible to visually discover the helicopter until late in the approach. I do not believe that I was given adequate separation. If ATC is unable to keep adequate separation of general aviation traffic from a helicopter performing a mission after a VIP TFR; then the FAA should at least issue a NOTAM to advise pilots of the hazard. This NOTAM should indicate the nature of the hazard and it should define how long the hazard will persist; so that pilots can plan their flights to avoid the hazard.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
401,401,401,401,8543,Flight was cleared for takeoff. I was Pilot Monitoring. I was expecting a left turn to 250 degrees after departure off [RWY] 31C. Tower issued a right turn to 130 degrees as we were spooling up the engines. I asked if he meant 250 degrees. Tower asked if we were going to ACITO; a departure fix. I said we were going to XXX. Tower's next response was 'Cancel takeoff clearance.'  The throttles were standing up; the engines were spooled and we were moving down the runway. I detected from Tower's tone and words that I had caused a lot of confusion.  In that context; I decided there was no safety of flight issue; so I pushed the FO's hands forward to set takeoff thrust and continue the takeoff. We turned right and were handed off to Departure. The rest of the flight was uneventful.Although departure headings are assigned all the time; perhaps ATC could say 'expect XXX heading'; while taxiing on to the runway so any resultant confusion could be addressed in a timelier manner.

403,403,403,403,8321,A C172 was in VFR conditions approximately 5-6 NM northwest of the airport when the field went IFR. I advised him the field was IFR and asked his intentions. He stated he wanted to come in for landing. I told him the field visibility was 2 miles and ceiling 700 FT broken and again asked his intentions. He said he wanted to land and he had a GPS he could use. I told him I couldn't authorize him to come in VFR. He also asked if I had him on RADAR. I told him I did and his position. I told him to maintain VFR and remain clear of Class C airspace. He said he couldn't maintain VFR. I told him Special VFR was available but he did not know what that was. Given that information; in my best judgment I decided to declare an emergency for him. I issued a heading of 180 with the intent to bring him towards the airport. I did not want to issue any instructions that would cause him to become spatially disoriented. Once he was about a mile offshore I told him of his position and asked if he had the shoreline in sight and he did. I told him to follow the shoreline to either Runway 20 or 23. I told him we turned on the runway lights to maximum intensity and asked if he could see either runway. Once he had the runways in sight; I cleared him to land on either Runway 20 or 23. He landed safely without incident. I recognize I should not have solicited Special VFR and should have issued a suggested heading instead of an assigned heading. Although the FLM advised me to issue the MOCA I did not because I did not want the pilot to think he had to climb and potentially become disoriented.

Air Carrier Y was on vectors from SBN 20 [NM] ENE at 7;000 FT. Initially [they were] on a 290 heading to go behind Air Carrier X. Both aircraft were operating at 250 KTS. I had to adjust heading to 310 and then 330 to stay behind Air Carrier X. I did get Visual Separation just prior to proximity being less than three miles laterally. Divergence was also in effect as the 310/330 headings were essentially a base leg and Air Carrier Y was on course to pass behind Air Carrier X. No Conflict Alert was activated. I feel the Fusion Radar presentation threw off my estimation of the closure rate and the converging courses; and it ended up being closer than I would have liked. My perception is that the Fusion display appears to jump with regard to the target position; refer to as 'stitching'.

Upon landing; the helicopter requested to perform hover work on Runway XX and I approved it; with no other traffic inbound. I then placed the helicopter memory aid on the radar display. Aircraft X reported on with me; approximately 6 miles east of the airfield. His data tag [showed] he was on a visual approach to Runway XX. I issued traffic to Aircraft X; for a C182 approximately 3 miles west of Aircraft X. Aircraft Z reported Aircraft X in sight to be no factor. I then issued traffic for Aircraft A who was 2 miles west of the extended final. Aircraft A reported Aircraft X in sight; and he was approved for visual separation.I then scanned Runway XX and cleared Aircraft X to land. I did not see the helicopter on the runway. I do not know if it was assumption bias; or the helicopter was behind a window beam from my perspective; or because the helicopter was black and seemed to blend in- I just didn't see him and I didn't scan the TDW (Tower Display Workstation) to see the helicopter memory aid.Aircraft X was approximately half-mile final; and asked if there was a dark piece of asphalt on the runway; or if it was a helicopter. I immediately remembered the helicopter and told Aircraft X that his landing clearance was cancelled and to make a go-around on the right side of the runway. Aircraft X came back stating that I was cut off; and asked about the dark mark on the runway. At this point; [the] helicopter was picking up from the runway; to a taxiway on the right side. So I told Aircraft X to go-around again; without the 'right side' instruction. Aircraft X stated that there must be something wrong with our radios and he was going around. I then instructed Aircraft X to enter right closed traffic and coordinated this with Approach Control.

408,408,408,408,7869,There was not much of an incident with the aircraft; I only put it in because I had to include an aircraft and this guy was delayed in getting his IFR clearance by a few minutes.I was working sector 15 with no D side and when I asked if I could have a D side because I was red (alert numbers showed something around 23; I think red for the sector is 18) and I was told that we didn't have a D side. We had all 7 sectors open with no D sides and nobody on break. I think 17 and 4 were both red at the time as well. I went over 2 hours on this session; and I believe one or two other people did. I had to delay IFR clearances for two aircraft because I felt like I was just hanging on; so I delayed them about 5 minutes each.

Drift is alive and well in all levels of management at ZLC. Management has decided that since it has worked sometimes to not staff to numbers; they will continue to do it.

409,409,409,409,5485,I was working SWF/PWL sectors combed with a D-side. I had a high volume of traffic and was holding for LGA due being below user minimums. I was given the current RVR and was told that if aircraft could take it; they could come into LGA. In the midst of relaying information to aircraft and some wanting to go and some not; I had to maneuver aircraft around traffic holding lower in the stack and simultaneously work several HPN; EWR; and TEB arrivals. I had a TEB jet and 2 EWR props to sequence even though our LOA states that we can give N90 Mugzy sector aircraft at 6000 and others and others in conflict at 7;000. In recent months; N90 has decided that they do not like this part of the LOA so have been making us spin aircraft at 070 with no notice. Since I did not want that to happen; I vectored the props behind the jet and gave them plenty of space. As I was busy clearing aircraft into LGA and several other things; the last EWR prop; Aircraft X was flashing at N90 Mugzy sector and entered their airspace without a hand off. The D-side brought it to my attention when it was much too late to avoid the airspace; Mugzy did not call us to put the aircraft into a hold or tell us to spin it; they simply did not take the handoff. We were too busy and did not notice the handoff had not been taken. A while later; the D-side called Mugzy to ask what the problem was and they said it was a EWR spacing problem.First; the LOA needs to change if it no longer suits N90's needs. Second; if it changes and we have to put all traffic over HUO in trail; we need to create a new route for EWR satellite jets as it is impossible sometimes to space jets behind props. Third; if a sector cannot take traffic; they should call the sector attempting hand off and let them know to hold or spin; not just not take the hand off. There have been countless times Mugzy just doesn't take the hand off even though we are fully compliant with LOAs; Miles-in-trail restrictions; and the like. It seems there is absolutely zero accountability for these people either holding aircraft unnecessarily or burdening our sector with no-notice/no communication holds.

411,411,411,411,7473,This instance occurred in a helicopter capable of a present position departure from a non movement area. Upon contracting ground; I requested a departure to the west after stating I was located at the ramp of [name removed].  Ground responded with 'Cleared downwind departure from present position stay clear of Class Charlie airspace.'  I responded by repeating the call verbatim.  I was not given any further commands nor told to standby or remain at current location; and since I was told my departure clearance I began to lift. I departed east initially into the wind; careful to avoid the runway centerline to ensure collision avoidance.  After takeoff the controller informed me I had committed a deviation because I had not been handed to tower.  I requested a right turn to downwind to avoid any possible traffic.  I was granted permission then told to call tower; while still not on tower frequency.  I was then told to contact tower frequency.  After making contact tower frequency cleared my departure from airspace and requested I call a number after reaching my destination.  Although my departure was premature given I hadn't contacted tower; I believe the heart of this issue was ground giving flight instructions and also not giving a subsequent frequency change to tower.  Aside from this instance; I have always contacted ground with present position and current info and been immediately assigned a tower frequency or a clearance via a taxiway.  Under ground control I was not given any sort of ground movement instructions; so I believe should have been immediately handed to tower with my request.  Again; I do not believe ground should issue a flight instruction. One other factor to this was that the previous afternoon I had contacted ground for a reposition on the airfield.  At that time the frequency was receiving ground; but also broadcasting tower commands.  (For instance I made my ground movement request but could here tower commands to an aircraft on downwind.)  When the event in question occurred; I did think it strange that a flight clearance was given from ground; but given the night before I was hearing tower commands from this channel; I unfortunately assumed that this was also a command from tower. Upon reaching my destination I contacted tower via phone and they stated the situation and that I had deviated because I departed without tower contact.  I explained my reasoning and they were very considerate.  They did make mention of an Archer on a one mile final that could have become an issue; but I feel that by staying clear of the runway at all times the risk of collision was very low.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

The Controller at Piarco Center said a couple of times that I was coming in weak and could not hear me too well; I could hear them loud and clear. She asked me to repeat the time; altitude; and air speed. I cannot recall if she read back the data or if she just said approved; but at the time we disconnected the call I was under the impression that Piarco Center had the correct data for this flight. I was relieved by another Controller and Developmental coming in to train and when I came back from break they had informed me that Piarco Center had called saying that the B747 had come over to them at FL380 and that they had shown the flight coordinated at FL360. The data on our end showed coordinated at FL380. Piarco Center said that the difference in altitude was not a factor for them; but they were still having problems hearing us. Recommendation; I would recommend installing a better voice line between ZNY and Piarco Center since we are always having problems hearing them or visa versa.

414,414,414,414,9587,Position worked; Radar Assist. L-side (monitor position) position was in use at this sector as well. I relieved someone else so the event was already in progress. Weather to the north; northwest and south of the sector. Almost every aircraft needed to deviate. Along with all the other usual traffic this sector sees; we were working IAD inbounds from ZBW; BWI departures going to the northeast and beyond; and LGA arrivals (all abnormal). There is NO WAY this sector should ever have this many aircraft; especially when 85% of them were climbing and descending. All sectors/facilities that border SIE had to be hold their traffic because there was too much saturation. TMU (Traffic management Unit) set this up for failure by essentially aiming all traffic at the SIE VOR. The area supervisor told me that when TMU wanted to run the LGA traffic through this sector; they responded by saying that was not a good idea; yet the LGA traffic ran anyway. Supervisor also told me that the area was never told there would be multiple BWI departures over SIE; so TMU agreed to something that this sector sees very seldom; yet nothing was communicated. I observed more present position holds issued in one session than I have in my almost 10 years as a controller combined. To say TMU dropped the ball is a gross understatement. Teach TMU to say 'NO' if a sector is saturated; and listen to the supervisors on the floor. If there will be abnormal traffic; give an accurate number instead of a low one to soften the blow. Telling the sector to expect 6 IAD inbounds from ZBW when in reality there were at least 15 is not cool. They have TSDs (Traffic Situational Displays) and know how to count; so there is no excuse. TMU needs to do a much better job in communicating the plan so that the sectors have a chance to say yes or no.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
415,415,415,415,9628,I departed Bountiful Skypark (BTF) on Runway 17 VFR and made left downwind avoiding Class B and climbed to 5;500 utilizing I15 VFR corridor to northwest. Within 2 miles I called SLC Approach to retrieve IFR flight plan. My plan was to pass under the active SLC approach corridor westbound at 5;500 under the class B airspace south of Hill AFB and pick up [my] IFR [flight plan] west of Antelope Island. Upon my second call to approach I heard the controller make a traffic call to a Skyhawk that was transiting the I15 corridor at 5;500 southeast inbound to BTF. I had the traffic on TCAS at 2 miles initially same altitude and when the Skyhawk didn't respond to the controller's traffic call I told approach I was the subject of the traffic call and had a request. There was no response from approach. I made a left turn to pass to the right of the Skyhawk right due to terrain to my right. Soon thereafter the Skyhawk turned right onto a collision course; and the Skyhawk reported negative visual on me. I got a traffic call from my TCAS of less than a mile same altitude; I climbed 500 feet to 6;000 and soon thereafter the Skyhawk passed on my right at less than a 1/2 mile and 500 feet below; I then had to immediately descend to 5;500 again to stay under Bravo and made my left turn to west to traverse under the SLC approach corridor.I finally got a squawk and was radar identified and was handed off to next controller and told to maintain VFR at 5;500. The base of the Bravo airspace east of Antelope Island is below terrain of the island almost 1;500 feet and only 2 miles east. Upon clearing the SLC approach corridor one has to climb at minimum of 2;000 FPM to clear terrain of Antelope Island. I was then asked to maintain 7;000 and VFR; which is only 400 feet from terrain; I indicated I would maintain VFR but needed to climb higher. With the workload of this complex route; terrain warnings and the prior traffic situation I accidentally continued my climb into the Bravo airspace west of Antelope Island with a base of 7;800. When I passed the demarcation line of Bravo going from a base of 6;000 to 7;800 I was so focused on clearing terrain and validating with terrain avoidance system that I missed the new floor of 7;800. I was given my IFR clearance as I climbed through 10;000 feet direct to BVL and realized I was in Bravo airspace without a clearance.Despite being a 450 hour a year pilot and going into the SLC area regularly; I will not go into BTF anymore as a result of this. The complex Bravo airspace and VFR corridors; when combined with terrain squeeze VFR aircraft into marginal areas for both traffic and terrain avoidance.

416,416,416,416,7220,Too many approach assignment changes resulted in very high workload and failure to tune the last ILS assigned. Root issue: ATIS information did not include the RNAV/RNP as an advertised approach in use. And scrambling to accommodate the last change distracted us from warning the flight attendants to prep for landing. Before top of descent we selected the advertised ILS for the most likely runway (we guessed right); prepped and briefed. Denver Approach advised us to expect the RNAV/RNP for the selected runway even though it had not been advertised as an approach in use. We accepted the change; prepped the cockpit and re-briefed for the RNAV/RNP. Then the next-to-last controller said we were going to be changed back to the ILS that we had previously briefed. I think this was just before we turned downwind on the FRNCH 3 Arrival. I pushed back and said we'd like to stay on the RNAV/RNP because we'd changed approaches once; re-prepped for the more complex approach; and it was getting late in the arrival. His response was that the next controller would make the ultimate decision and to contact her. We changed frequencies abeam the field and were told we would be flying the ILS. I pushed again because it was very late to be making those changes. [Controller] said they were unable [to issue] the RNAV/RNP and that we would be flying the ILS. Somewhere in that process we had a TCAS event (you can hear it on the radio as my First Officer (FO) was responding to the controller) which didn't help the workload. It wasn't an RA - it was a TA; but it still required our attention until we understood the threat. After considering the big picture I elected to accept the ILS and we started the process of setting the cockpit back up for the ILS. Before everything was set; we were given a base leg which in retrospect we should not have accepted. We weren't ready for the approach. But we turned anyway because the controller was 'explaining' her reason for giving us the ILS and we couldn't respond right away and I didn't want to continue on an unassigned heading without her knowing. [Controller] then turned us dogleg and cleared us for the approach. I hit the APP button but the approach wouldn't arm because it wasn't tuned. We caught it before we flew through final; but it was a near thing. And it was about that time that I realized I had not warned the flight attendants to prep for landing. Not good. From there the approach and landing were uneventful. I regret taking the turn to base leg. That done; I regret not abandoning the approach as soon as I realized we weren't tuned/briefed and fully ready for the approach. I should have gone around from outside the FAF and gone back to the radar pattern to set it up again.

417,417,417,417,7565,We were descending normally on the ILS to runway 35L.  ATC had reduced us to final approach speed outside of the FAF.  Shortly after the FAF Monitor told us 'Cancel approach clearance; climb to 9;000 feet and track the localizer'.  Captain disconnected the autopilot; advanced the power and brought the nose up to start the climb to 9;000.  Shortly after I read back the clearance Monitor informed us that tower had a visual on us and proceeding traffic and we could continue the approach if we wanted. I suggested we continue with the missed approach.  At this point we were at approx. 150 knots and starting to climb and one dot above the localizer.  Captain decided to continue the approach and as I was relaying that to ATC he pitched down to regain the glideslope.  Our vertical speed hit 1800 FPM down and the GPWS gave us a 'Don't Sink' and 'PULL UP; PULL UP' warnings.  I called for a go around and captain replied 'I got it.' and continued the approach.  We sank below the glideslope and now had 1000 FPM climb to regain it.  I called 'Unstable; go around' and moved my hand behind the power levers to advance the power if the callout was ignored a second time.  This time Captain initiated a go around by advancing the power; pressing the go-around button and calling 'Positive rate; gear up.'  I prompted for flaps 10; got no response and moved the flaps to 10.  I then stated 'Positive Rate' and raised the gear.  At this point I was able to make a missed approach call to tower and we were told to maintain 9;000 feet and immediately turn to a 080 heading for Airbus traffic.  Captain started a standard rate turn to 080 heading and we were at 6;700 feet when I called 'acceleration altitude'.  We cleaned up the plane and ATC told us to make an immediate turn to 105 heading for the traffic.  Captain increased bank to 30 degrees to comply.  We leveled at 9;000 feet and were handed off to approach control for another approach.Suggestions:Several factors led to this event.  ATC should have never offered to let us continue the approach.  There should have never been an attempt to continue the approach.  Go-Around callouts should have been made and the commitment to the go-around when the approach clearance was cancelled.  An immediate go-around should have been initiated at the first GPWS warning (Don't Sink).  And it should never take two go-around calls to make a go-around happen.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Called Ground and was given taxi instructions to [Runway] XXR via [taxi instructions]; cross Runway XY. After crossing Runway XY; we began running the before takeoff checklist. Approaching Taxiway X; the Captain saw a CRJ to our left southbound on [taxiway X] that wasn't giving way. He had to aggressively apply the brakes to stop the aircraft in time. Had he not applied the brakes; a collision would have occurred. We both were certain we had not been given instructions to give way to or follow the CRJ; nonetheless; I queried Ground Control to see if we had missed an instruction or were supposed to give way to the CRJ. The Controller replied that we had not been told to give way and that she thought the CRJ would have been further down the taxiway by the time we got to the intersection. Shortly after this; we got a call from the Number 1 Flight Attendant informing us that the Number 4 Flight Attendant had fallen during the hard braking. The Captain asked if she was okay or if we should return to the gate to which the Number 1 [Flight Attendant] replied that he would check on her status. When he called back; he said that she would be okay and she wanted to continue. We then departed and the remainder of the flight was uneventful. During the departure briefing; we had discussed potential threats including it was dark; starting to rain; and possible distractions from the new checklist. It turned out that the new checklist was in fact a distraction and caused more heads down time than normal; but it was not the cause of this event. It is possible that with more heads up time the Captain may have seen the traffic slightly sooner and not needed to brake quite as aggressively. The event occurred because the Ground Controller failed to instruct us to give way to the CRJ or vice versa and we failed to detect the conflict in time to brake in a normal manner. Contributing was the design of the new checklist which does result in more heads down time for the captain.In the future; I will encourage waiting to run the checklist until we are on a straight section of taxiway with no upcoming turns or intersections and stop if necessary; especially at night or in low visibility.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
419,419,419,419,10012,[I] was cleared direct MIBOE (IAF) for the RNAV 13 approach at D38. I was on autopilot and tracking direct to MIBOE when ATC called and stated we were off course by 2 miles. Certified Garmin 530w showed airplane was tracking properly as did 2 onboard portable GPS units. There were no NOTAMs I saw that indicated RAIM [Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring] might be out and the 530w was in approach mode. I relayed my concern and informed ATC that 3 GPS units indicated we were on proper course and heading and had in fact passed over top of MIOBE and was on course to CAMEY (IAF). ATC canceled approach clearance at this time and issued a heading of 100 and descent to 2;500 to see if contact with surface was possible. The course of 100 took me through the approach course; which I think I communicated to ATC; then to an area northeast of D38. I was over a solid undercast and visual contact with the ground was not possible. I was then asked intentions; requested the approach again and was vectored and cleared for the RNAV 13 approach once more with vectors to CAMEY. This time ATC radar and the onboard GPS seemed to agree and the approach was flown and a missed was declared. When I returned to my home base I reviewed the flight track as recorded on my portable Garmin 696 GPS. Its history showed that it was flown directly over MIBOE and was on course to CAMEY when ATC canceled the approach and issued the 100 heading.

420,420,420,420,2682,Reported inbound to ZZZ with a student on board. Controller was having a meltdown over the frequency speaking with another aircraft. The same controller issued an incorrect clearance to the same aircraft and acknowledged that he had made an error over the frequency; continuing his meltdown over the frequency; with other aircraft; as well. The Controller issued a clearance to us; to report a right downwind for Runway XX. We acknowledged the clearance; then asked if he wanted us to report over the lake; as well. He went ballistic; starting yelling over the frequency and said that he had asked us to report a right downwind for Runway XX. I responded that he shouldn't yell over the frequency. On many occasions; this same controller would issue a clearance to report a right downwind for Runway 'X' and we would follow the clearance and report a right downwind for Runway 'XX'. Once there he would make this same mistake on repeated occasions and yell over the frequency and say why we didn't report over the lake when he never made such a request. By requesting confirmation that he wanted us to report the lake or not; was actually helping him. Again; he responded to this assistance with an inappropriate outburst. The lake is used at ZZZ as a reporting point prior to entering right downwind for Runway XX or; a left base for Runway YY. This same controller also made a mistake on a taxi clearance once we had exited the runway; even after two attempts of correcting his error. This controller is a danger to Aviation. He has frequent outbursts and regular meltdowns over the frequency. Aside from the mistakes; which isn't the main issue; his conduct violates acceptable use of the air traffic frequency. Not only is his conduct inappropriate; but he is a danger to aviation. A controller as is the case of this individual; does not belong in the tower.

421,421,421,421,2673,After we received taxi Inst from ZZZZ ground to taxi X to Y to XXL hold point we proceeded as instructed. We stopped at the intersection of X and Y because a Aircraft Y was holding on Y. I stopped shorter than I normally do because I didn't want to be sitting in his Number 1 engine wake while sitting still. We had brakes parked. My First Officer looked to his right and commented that an aircraft was approaching from the right on Taxiway Y. After a few seconds he said he's coming fairly fast and it didn't look as if he was slowing. We both realized at the same time he was going to continue and not stop. I flashed my R turnoff lights then my taxi lights to alert him of our close relationship. He never slowed. My First Officer made two 'aircraft stop' transmissions with no reaction. Looking at his wingtip approaching our cockpit I made the comment 'hang on guys' and his wingtip passed within 10 feet. of our windscreen. We told ATC of what happened. She came back and said; 'sorry for [the] inconvenience.' I have never been so mad and scared in my over 30 years here at [Company]. There are no holding lines or holding instructions given to us. We were cleared to the runway. Either Ground Control or Aircraft Y made a horrible mistake; potentially ending our lives by driving their wingtip through our cockpit.I think either ATC gave two clearances to both of us Aircraft X and Aircraft Y; or Aircraft Y had an ATC taxi violation. Regardless Aircraft Y either ignored our lights flashing and radio calls or was not looking outside past the center line of the taxiway. I have no clue to his thought process.If a Tower Frequency change was given to Aircraft Y prior to our intersection; that policy MUST stop. If he could have heard us tell him to stop it would have prevented a possible collision.

422,422,422,422,9244,I was working the DAL arrival position (AR7). The aircraft involved were being vectored to the parallel Runways 13L & 13R for visual approaches. An E145 was arriving from the west on a procedure that is part of the problem that contributed to this event. The procedure drops the aircraft from west of the airport out of 11;000 FT; making it very difficult to get the aircraft lower and sequenced with traffic from the east side of the airport. The procedure had been suspended just prior to the event due to weather impact. The E145 was one of the first couple aircraft to come in this way again. A SR22 was inbound from the north of DAL. The aircraft was following a P3; which involved wake turbulence. The P3 was following a prior ILS practice approach aircraft. I was vectoring the E145 (Runway 13R) and the SR22 (Runway 13L) for visual approaches into DAL. I was setting up a 30 degree turn-on between the two aircraft using altitude. The SR22 did not descend as I intended. The incident occurred during the turn to final. I attempted to provide visual separation; but it was too late. The final into DAL has only about 10 miles of airspace to work with. In this situation; the slow descent by the SR22 was a problem. Recommendation; to prevent the re-occurrence of this event; I would recommend cancelling what is called the 'OVER THE TOP' procedure into DAL. It is dangerous; fails too many times; and the complexity it causes is tremendous. This has been reported as an issue for years at this facility.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
423,423,423,423,6421,I was working the VERDE Sector (South Finals) with aircraft X; a B737. Simultaneous visual approaches were in progress to both Runway 8 and 7R.  I was sequencing straight in traffic with downwind traffic to Runway 7R and provided my runway to a Heavy KC35 inbound from the FREEWAY Sector (North Finals). I sequenced the B737 off the downwind; to follow a Heavy KC35 being worked by the FREEWAY Sector. I was trying to provide appropriate wake turbulence separation of 5 NM between the B737 and the Heavy KC35 and so I waited until I had just over 6 miles before I turned the B737 and cleared him for the visual approach to Runway 7R behind the KC35.  The B737 turned slower than expected; and he overshot the 7R localizer and encroached upon the localizer for Runway 8.  This put them in conflict with an Airbus being sequenced by the FREEWAY Sector to Runway 8.  I heard the FREEWAY Controller say the Airbus had my B737 in sight and was instructed to maintain visual separation.  My B737 corrected and reestablished themself on the Runway 7R localizer and continued and completed their approach for Runway 7R.  The Airbus did so as well. According to the 7110.65; I was 'okay' in this incident because I cleared my aircraft for a visual approach to Runway 7R before separation was lost due to the fact that the Runways 8 and 7R are more than 4300 FT apart.  Aircraft came approximately 1 to 2 miles apart; but this was an unsafe situation due to my B737 overshooting the localizer.   In retrospect; I should have turned the B737 to intercept and join the visual approach to Runway 7R just a little bit sooner.  I waited longer because I was trying to provide wake turbulence separation.  The B737 did report the Heavy KC35 in sight and was instructed to 'follow......caution wake turbulence'.  Because of this incident; there was a 'snowball' effect; and two or three subsequent arrivals collapsed in regards to spacing.  For the next two or three arrivals I had marginal separation and had to call the tower to request visual separation.  The tower approved all requests for visual separation and stated that aircraft were 'in sight'. Recommendation; I would recommend that we stop being encouraged to 'SWAP' runways so much.  I felt compelled to give my runway away during this scenario for the Heavy KC35 being worked by FREEWAY.  If I did not give my runway away during this scenario; it would have not happened the way it did.  It was a complex scenario because the KC35 had to cross the Runway 8 final and 'hit a hole' in front of several of my straight in arrivals as well as a downwind aircraft.  It helps if the other Final Controller realizes when requesting a 'swap' is going to cause undue hardship to the other final.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

425,425,425,425,6684,I had filed an IFR flight plan from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and received back an expected route from ATC. I had planned to depart Runway XX; as the wind was calm. The field was initially IFR. I started the engine and entered the expected route into my GPS. By the time I was ready to taxi; the weather had become marginal VFR and aircraft had started using Runway YY. So; I taxied to YY for departure. As I taxied out; I got a radio check from UNICOM.ZZZ is a non-towered airport; so I used the ATC frequency given on the approach plates to contact clearance. This was my usual procedure at this airport. However; after trying many times I could not get a response from anyone on the clearance frequency. Since the field was marginal VFR at that time and weather at my destination was clear; I decided to depart VFR and see if I could get a clearance in the air. Otherwise; I planned to just proceed VFR. There was a low layer of clouds to the west and it was clear to the north. If I could not get a clearance; my plan was to climb to the northeast until I was at an altitude sufficiently above the clouds to the west and then turn west.There is a class C airspace to the west of ZZZ. As I climbed out; I turned to the right to avoid the class C airspace. However; I guess I still had in mind my plan to depart Runway XX and only turned to the right the amount I usually do when departing Runway XX to easily clear the class C airspace. The low layer of clouds to the west prevented me from visually realizing that I had not turned far enough to the right. Another issue; that was a distraction as I climbed out; was my attempt to contact departure to get my clearance or get flight following. The Departure Controller was refusing to talk to any VFR traffic. He finally told all VFR traffic to try again in 30 minutes.After giving up on ATC; I realized from my GPS that I had entered the northeast corner of the class C airspace to the west. I immediately turned to the northeast to exit the airspace. The ADS-B on my GPS did not show any traffic anywhere near me.I clearly did not keep foremost in mind that I was not departing from the runway that I had planned to and the impact of departing VFR instead of IFR at the last minute; because I could not get a clearance. I certainly will be more careful in the future. I will also change my expectations of the usual high level of service from ATC while COVID-19 is in place.

428,428,428,428,1720,This event occurred during on-the-job training. It has become common practice in our facility to keep multiple sectors combined due to minimal staffing. In the past; these two subject sectors would be split apart throughout the busy hours of the day because of the unpredictable nature for the two sectors to suddenly increase in both volume and complexity. At any moment this combined sector; can be sequencing arrivals to four satellite airports; feeding arrivals and working the bulk of departures off the primary airport; separating en route aircraft across 70 miles of airspace; and have 13 other sectors calling for coordination. At the time of this event; it was moderately busy and the trainee asked for help but it was already too late to split the sectors. I told her to keep working and the Controller-In-Charge came over to coordinate as it became unmanageable. The loss of separation occurred when the trainee descended a Mooney from 7;000 FT to 5;000 FT while converging with a Navion at 6;000 FT. I did not hear the trainee make the transmission to the Mooney because I was giving instructions to turn other aircraft at the time he/she issued the descent instruction. Traffic volume has been steadily decreasing over the last few years at our facility and it has become a common practice to combine our five operational positions into just two. The motivation behind this has been to increase volume and complexity for the trainee and that the staffing level does not permit us to both train and have more scopes open. Some of the trainees are not proficient or experienced enough to train on combined sectors and it is putting an undue hardship on the instructors to accomplish training. Many of the trainees have no air traffic experience and don't understand the basic fundamentals. Instructors are trying to teach this at the same time as managing unpredictable traffic volume. Management needs to hold regular training team meetings and have skill checks performed by certified personnel to identify weaknesses in the trainee. Training should be tailored to the trainees skill level (i.e. splitting sectors) and skill enhancement training performed where necessary.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

The Captain proceeded to tell ATC about our RA as well as the traffic we flew over. ATCs response was merely a 'roger'. ATC never called out the traffic; and seemed un-phased by the near miss. My approximation put the other aircraft less than 500 ft vertically and nearly 0 ft laterally once we flew over him.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

434,434,434,434,3709,We were doing a reposition flight with no passengers from ZZZ1 to ZZZ. Prior to this flight I was mainly focused on our next leg which was supposed to be from ZZZ to ZZZ2 but was switched last minute to ZZZ3 due to weather. I was in constant communication with Dispatch while preflighting as ZZZ2 and ZZZ3 were both siting right around approach minimums and there were complications arranging the guests' ground transportation as this was a very busy travel day. My focus was definitely on the second flight rather than the 10 min repo to ZZZ. I had checked the weather earlier that day for ZZZ and saw VFR all day however I did not check the METAR there before I took off. There wasn't a cloud in the sky at ZZZ1 and they were departing north. Because of that; I made the mistake of assuming that we would be getting a visual to one of the north runways at ZZZ. We got the ZZZ ATIS as soon as possible and were very surprised to hear that it was reporting IFR at ZZZ. I could actually see the runway while being vectored. There was a strange cloud bank at ZZZ that was sitting over only the north half of the airport but the approach end and area where we were being vector was completely VMC. We checked on to the ZZZ Approach frequency handling planes on final and were told 'Fly heading 090; vectors for the ILS Runway XXL.' My SIC who was Pilot Monitoring loaded up the approach in the FMS and selected 'vectors' as the Initial Approach Fix. This put ZZZZZ (the final app fix) and ZZZZZ1 (one fix further out) into our FMS. As we were completing the In Range Checklist and about to start briefing the approach; we were given a poor vector to intercept final. It was such a sharp turn that I had to kick off the autopilot to avoid drastically over shooting final; potentially into traffic on the parallel ILS for XXR. Right about the time that we intercepted the localizer; ATC instructed us to 'Maintain 10;000 until ZZZZZ2 and cleared for the ILS Runway XXL'. At that point; we realized we didn't have ZZZZZ2 in the FMS as it was outside ZZZZZ1 further back on the final approach course. Shortly after; I saw the FMS' descent profile telling me to descend in order to be at ZZZZZ1 at 9;000 per the approach chart. In my rushed and slightly confused state; I mistook it this FMS reading for the actual glideslope and started descending. I knew we were cleared on the approach and I assumed we had already passed ZZZZZ2. As we approached about 9;500 MSL; ATC called and said 'Your clearance was to maintain 10;000 until ZZZZZ2; I'm showing you at 9500'. My SIC responded 'Correcting' and I brought the plane back up to 10;000 feet. Shortly after we intercepted the actual glideslope and landed. We were completely VMC throughout the entire approach. After landing; I spoke with ATC via phone and he informed that there was a regional jet below us at 9;000 feet that had to be vectored because we broke the required separation for an ILS approach. We never received a traffic alert or even noticed him on our TCAS display. The controller mentioned to me that if we were on the visual rather than ILS; it would not have been a factor. I think there were several factors that led to this event. First and foremost; I did not prepare for this flight as much as I should have. I was much more focused on the difficult second leg with passengers to ZZZ3. In my mind; I thought this was going to be an easy 10 minute flight with a visual approach into ZZZ; something I had done dozens of times at my previous job. I was not in the proper mindset for a true ILS approach. The fact that we were VMC and I had the runway in sight definitely added to this. Second; it was such a short flight that we really didn't have time to properly brief the approach. I think about a minute and half passed between the time we were told to expect the ILS XXL and when we were getting a vector to intercept the localizer. Third; it was a poor vector to intercept and required me to start hand flying which definitely took away from situational awareness of where we were on the approach. Fourth; there was a breakdown in our usual crew duties of Pilot Flying and Pilot Monitoring. The SIC (Pilot Monitoring) was very overloaded with work doing the comms and loading the FMS and I thought it would be helpful if I called the FBO to let them know we were 5 minutes out. I made this call right about the time we got the vector to intercept which was foolish and unnecessary. I also did a poor job communicating with the SIC and did not announce that I was leaving 10;000 which is standard protocol. Lastly; I think it would have been helpful for the controller to say vectors to ZZZZZ2 for the ILS rather than just vectors to the ILS. This would have made it easier to properly program in the FMS in a very short period of time. Going forward; I will make sure I am completely focused on the current flight; no matter how short and seemingly routine. I will also strive to always maintain the proper Pilot Flying and Pilot Monitoring roles and to strictly stick to SOPs no matter how work saturated I become. This has been a major learning moment for me to understand that you can never become complacent in the cockpit; especially in an IFR environment.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
435,435,435,435,4183,On arrival to DEN we flew ANCHR 4 RNAV while planning for ILS 35L Approach. When switched to initial Approach Controller; were given ILS 35R. Changed approach; programmed box; rebriefed; continued on. Once in terminal area passing FULLA and approaching FFFAT we were given new approach to RNAV (RNP) Z 35R; assigned speed of 210 at DOGGG. Changed approach; programmed box; attempted briefing while programming; [and] continued on. Shortly thereafter; Approach Controller asked why we refused to accept RNAV 35R Approach. Wasn't clear on what prompted that inquiry; but immediately following it; we were given a heading to fly (right turn); then asked to report the airport for a Visual Approach 35R. Then another heading (further right) to intercept the localizer for ILS 35R. We flew a visual/backed ILS approach to 35R. Landed uneventfully. Taxied to gate. I requested a number to contact the Controller upon completion of flight. After deplaning; we discussed/debriefed the flight and in particularly the sequence of events during the terminal phase of flight. While approach didn't query our position (RNAV phase of approach) I suspect I may have flown over the waypoint from which I was to start the turn towards the runway (time/distance between where given new approach and beginning of RNAV approach wasn't sufficient to properly perform required duties. ie; program and properly sequence waypoints). While enroute to the hotel I contacted the Center and spoke with the Operational Supervisor. We had a good lengthy discussion and debrief about what transpired; from their perspective and from our perspective. Exchanged input as to what could have been done to make that sequence of events more smooth and less complicated for the both of us. He said he was going to submit an internal report on the event explaining how they can better assist us (arriving aircraft) without unknowingly increasing our workload.

436,436,436,436,2290,On approach to Runway 16L descending just prior to KIKME Intersection an Airbus overshot the 16R localizer and flew what appeared to be less than 200 FT directly below our aircraft. Tower on frequency 120.8 did not call the traffic. We received a split last second RA and then it cleared. While it cleared I saw the Airbus banking away from us in a descent. This is the closest I have ever come to a mid air collision in my entire career!I am still trying to determine how the Airbus got so close so fast. At this point I have to assume that they were at a very aggressive intercept angle. The whole time our aircraft was on the localizer and glideslope with the autopilot on and the needles were perfectly aligned.  We were in a stable descent on the glideslope well before seeing the Airbus.  The flight landed without further incident. The threats were the Airbus flying underneath our aircraft.  ATC not calling out either the Airbus or the other airliner to our left until after we told them what had happened.

437,437,437,437,176,I was the First Officer and Pilot Monitoring for this flight.  Near the end of our taxi it was a rather busy time due to our starting the second engine followed by the Before Takeoff Check.  As I went off comm to make the departure PA I had the VHF 1 comm button pressed down so I could still hear ATC.  Just before I keyed the mic to make my PA call I heard Tower call us and thought I heard them say; 'XXXX cleared for Take Off runway XX; landing traffic 13 mile final.'  So I went ahead and made my PA telling the passengers '...we are cleared for Take Off; flight attendants please prepare the cabin for departure.'  When I returned to VHF 1 I completed the before takeoff checklist; verified we were entering the correct runway and also verified with the Captain that we were cleared for Take Off which I thought I had heard Tower say and the Captain replied in the affirmative.  We began our Take Off roll and somewhere around 100kts Tower called; 'XXXX you do not have a Take Off clearance!'  I responded; 'You want us to abort?' and Tower replied; 'Affirmative!'  The aircraft reached a max IAS of 115-120kts during the rejected Take Off.  The Captain/Pilot Flying brought the aircraft to a stop and taxied clear of the runway uneventfully.  I ran the table for the Vmbe in the QRH and found our Vmbe = 183 which was well below our Max IAS.  Our Brake Temperature Monitoring System (BTMS) indications did not exceed a 4 on any one brake.  We then contacted Maintenance and had them inspect our brakes and fuse plugs before departure. Both the Captain and I; the First Officer understood we were cleared for Takeoff.  We both heard it on the radio and even verified it with each other.  It was a busy time between checklists and receiving our clearance from ATC.  Since I was still monitoring VHF 1 while making my PA I did not think to question what I thought I had heard.Even if monitoring VHF 1 while off frequency the pilot that was off frequency should still confirm with ATC a Take Off clearance and not just verify it with the other pilot.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
438,438,438,438,7825,The Captain was flying the Pegasus 757 on flight to MPTO while I was working the radio during our descent. The ACARS weather at MPTO showed 2000 FT scattered and 9000 meters of visibility. 100 miles out Panama Control told us to expect the VOR to Runway 21L. We set up and briefed that approach. We were then cleared direct to TBG VOR; a VOR that is eighteen miles south of the MPTO airport. This meant that we would have had to fly twenty miles south of the airport; reverse course in a holding pattern; and then travel north before turning around to align with Runway 21L. Not only would this have been challenging given the difficult environment with Panama ATC; but it would have added seventy miles to the flight versus a clearance to join the final approach course from the north. Since we were Pegasus equipped; we asked for the RNAV to 21R with a side-step to 21L. Panama Control approved our request. The 737 ahead of us then asked for the RNAV approach to 21R with a side-step to the left side as well. They didn't respond to the 737; and later gave them headings for the ILS to 3R with a circle to 21R. We were then handed off to another Controller who advised us we would be given the 'ILS and circle to 21L.' This made no sense so I clarified. I knew there was only one ILS at MPTO but I wanted to be entirely specific. 'Confirm the ILS to 3R with a circle to land on Runway 21L?' I asked. There was no response. We continued on the heading; fairly certain we were being vectored for the approach to 3R with a circle to 21L just as the 737 ahead of us. We briefed the new approach and go-around; but we both commented that since we were visual; the go-around would more than likely be given by the Controller. The ATIS was only effective within fifty miles of the airport and the recording alternated in Spanish and English; making it hard to get the entire ATIS in one uninterrupted listen during this busy phase of flight. Communication with ATC was extremely frustrating. The flight ahead asked multiple times what the wind speed and direction were and the Controller didn't know what he was asking. We were given a 360 heading and told to descend to 1700 FT with a clearance to join the localizer to 3R. We accomplished that and put in 1200 FT in the MCP for the circling approach to 21L. The Tower Controller then asked us if we'd like to land on Runway 3R instead. We asked the Tower the winds and during his long and detailed response; I felt we weren't in position to accept the straight in to 3R. I looked to my right and saw a cloud that may have been in our way during the circling approach; so I announced to the Tower that we were going around and they came back and said; 'Roger; you're cleared for the circling approach to Runway 21R.' The Captain thought we could immediately accept the circling approach as we had planned and told me to put the gear down. I put the gear down and told him I thought we wouldn't be stable if we did that. He recognized my concern and agreed that we should go around. During the missed approach I attempted to get the new heading and altitude from the tower while the Captain turned right; toward the published missed. The flaps were at five degrees; so there was no need to make any changes according to the litany. The missed approach altitude wasn't set and remained at the 1200 FT we had used for the circling approach altitude while I asked the Controller what heading and altitude he wanted. I asked this question two or three times; and absolutely could not understand the Controller's responses. The busy go-around environment may have made it more difficult for me to understand than it should have been. The speed was rapidly accelerating past 200 KTS; and I was concerned the Captain would over speed the flaps by exceeding the 220 knot limit speed. I told the Captain to watch his speed and knew it would be tough to keep under the 220 knot limit; so without command; I retracted the flaps to one and said; 'I got flaps toone.' I asked the Controller again about the heading and altitude and was able to understand a clearance to 3100 FT and a heading of 130; essentially what the Captain was doing. As an aside; typically in the US the heading is announced before the altitude in this situation. It was reversed by this Controller; and the 3100 FT; 130 heading were rather hard to understand given the accent. At this point; I looked down and saw our airspeed was below the flaps speed for flaps one. I told the Captain he was getting slow and he responded with an immediate increase in thrust and lowered the nose. He later told me that he had been thinking he was at flaps fifteen; and I explained that we started the go-around at flaps five and that I retracted the flaps to one as we came close to the flap over speed limit. Effective crew communication during this flap movement wasn't easy as the Controller was speaking throughout the missed approach. We flew the remainder of the missed approach accurately. At this point; a straight in approach looked safer than the circling approach; so we requested the ILS to Runway 3R with a tailwind of eight knots. The runway was 10;007 FT long and dry. We landed uneventfully on 3R. The Controllers on the ground were very apologetic for the confusion and multiple approaches that we were told to expect. In hindsight; while bringing the flaps up to prevent an over speed seemed like a good idea to me at the time; it created a configuration where the Captain thought he had more flaps than he did; resulting in a situation that could have been more serious than an over speed. Since go-arounds are likely to be more common with the added emphasis on stabilized approaches; I hope they'll be featured in the simulator more; and not just from the missed approach point. Doing them before the marker would be helpful. Discussing the appropriate response by the non flying pilot if a flap over speed is imminent would also be helpful..,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
439,439,439,439,6456,At PHX there [are] two departure sectors; North Departures Navajo and South Departures Santan. All northbound departures go out to 9 miles on west flow and turn to a 360 heading and all fly the same departure on east flow until Departure Sectors separate them. The Tower launches most of our traffic visually without regard to aircraft type or aircraft characteristics. So a northbound can be visual with another northbound departure even though the courses do not diverge until the Departure Sector separates the two. In many cases there are over takes and situations where the trail aircraft out climbs the lead aircraft making it impossible to maintain visual separation with the lead aircraft. This is a rather big issue at PHX that never gets resolved. In this case an A321 was launched on a Silow2 departure and an A319 was launched on the SJN6 departure with less than one and a half miles between them. The A319 had a 20 KT overtake and was well out climbing the A321. At the 9 DME the A319 was 1;500 FT above and half mile in trail. Due to this I know there is no was they can still have visual separation with the A321. I stopped the A321 climb and turned the A319 to provide adequate and safe separation. We should not allow visual separation on same direction SIDs. No visual on two north or south bound departures. Visual should only be applied between a north and a south bound departure.

440,440,440,440,8344,Just prior to commencing the LOWBO 3 RNAV Arrival; we received a clearance to descend to FL290. Prior to BRMLY (the start of the arrival) we received clearance; 'After BRMLY cleared direct JOKLO; cross JOKLO at 15;000 ft.' Just prior to BRMLY we were given direct to JOKLO. While proceeding to JOKLO; ATC said something like; 'for now you can descend at Pilots Discretion to FL280.' Both the F/O and I interpreted this to mean; if we desired we could descend to FL280 but that the original crossing restriction of 15;000 ft at JOKLO was still applicable. This also made sense because BRMLY had a published crossing restriction of FL290. We simply thought that ATC was telling us we could descend out of FL290 since we were direct JOKLO. ATC never used any terminology as to 'amending' our clearance or Pilot Discretion 'maintain' FL280. Nor was our original crossing restriction at JOKLO at 15;000 ft cancelled. Passing FL265; ATC queried us if that was our correct altitude; because he had 'amended' our clearance to FL280.

I understand FAA control facilities do not operate by [my company's] FOM; but it is very carefully distilled from FAA documents and procedures. I don't know what the actual source is. I do know people at [my company] didn't make it up.I spoke with a supervisor at IAD tower yesterday who did not agree that this is the case so I feel the issue should be followed up officially and decided.  I also feel there are unnecessary threats and degradations to safety being created by either Potomac Approach and/or Dulles tower in the issuance of RNAV SID's that are not being used as designed. I pointed out that the heading issued by IAD tower is at least 9 times out of 10 redundant to the published SID. That is to say; it is exactly what is called for on the SID.  The supervisor did not agree with my assessment of this either and when I suggested it would be easier and less confusing to allow flights to fly the SID's without the heading assignment; I was told that would never happen at Dulles.So the reason there is a threat here is because Dulles is issuing clearances that are simple to understand and replacing them at the last moment; literally as a flight is lining up to takeoff with something that because it's a change (they are saying the words after all) which gets ones attention yet is not a change at all. That causes confusion. Additionally the clearance is actually in error since it is technically a change (even though it really isn't) and should have an altitude assignment associated with it; but it doesn't.  Lots of opportunity to get confused and make an error.Lastly; this is all supposed to be a precursor and first steps of NextGen. What good will all the time; expense; and effort of NextGen be if a major facility like Dulles and Potomac can arbitrarily write their own rules and disregard what the rest of the country is doing?,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
442,442,442,442,9847,A supervisor was working traffic that was too busy. There was complex weather that had reports of extreme turbulence where the pilot had lost control of their aircraft briefly in the next sector. The traffic was moderate and starting to back up because of the delays and holding in the sector. In the beginning the sectors were combined. The Controller In Charge (CIC) came over and asked the Supervisor Radar Controller if he wanted to split the sectors and he replied yes. The de-combining of the sectors was not a factor of the incident in my opinion.There were two aircraft holding at an intersection at the time; one at 7000 feet and one at 8000 feet. There was a VFR target that had no code indicating 7500 feet heading on a northwest track for the holding pattern. This same aircraft I had noticed had initially been at 9500 feet. I told the supervisor to 'Watch out for that 095 ...'. This target was in conflict with an arrival leaving 10000 feet for 7000 feet. The supervisor turned the arrival to the east and it was not a factor. The report of extreme turbulence had been reported by a PC12 from 3000-6000 feet and the weather had now moved becoming a problem for the Arrival aircraft. All of the arrivals required 2-3 point outs and I suggested to the supervisor to hold the aircraft north of the weather so it would create less safety hazards; work and no one would go anywhere near the extreme turbulence that was moving in. He did not take my suggestion and I kept doing the point outs and coordination. Poor judgment was used in this situation.After getting off the line with one Center sector on a point out I noticed the 7500 foot target 5 miles from the 7000 foot IFR traffic in holding. I asked my supervisor 'did you call that traffic'; the supervisor responded 'no; I didn't see it'. The aircraft holding then turned into the VFR aircraft because he was starting his turn in the hold. The supervisor issued a Traffic Alert and the targets merged; but the VFR target had climbed up to 7900 feet. After the target (not in communications with Air Traffic) passed the IFR aircraft in our sector the target started descending below 6500 feet but was no longer a factor. The 8000 foot IFR aircraft that was originally in holding had been cleared out of holding and handed off to the next sector. During this same session a MSV departure departed. The supervisor instructed me not to take the handoff because 'We shouldn't be working these guys.' Center sector that was working the airplane had to call for a handoff and the supervisor was reluctant to take it even though there was no traffic or complexity with the aircraft in this situation. He finally took radar contact on the aircraft and climbed him to 17000 feet. This contributed to the complexity of the Assist-side duties because now a point out to Approach was required and a call on a handoff to a Center. During this time I was also calling other Center sectors for point outs. I do not recall if this was after or before the situation with the Traffic Alert.The workload was too great for the supervisor to be working and his judgment was poor creating safety hazards; a safety event (Traffic Alert); and increased workload. The first recommendation would be to not allow supervisors to work busy traffic. Controlling airplanes is not their primary job and they should work light traffic ('Green'). If staffing is an issue there should be more Traffic Management initiatives instead of a supervisor working busy traffic.The second recommendation is to have the MSV departures worked by Center again. If they were flight planned on a different route it would take off a few miles on their route and additional Center sectors would not have to work the aircraft. The reason it is complicated for Center is because their sector has minimal time to climb the aircraft; possibly do a point out to Approach and call on a handoff since the aircraft handoff is initiated after the 'two minutes from theboundary' rule. It is also complex because the Center Sector gets aircraft from Approach; an adjacent center; and EWR Satellite traffic all in the area of MSV.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
443,443,443,443,5395,Aircraft X checked onto our frequency at and needed a weather deviation; however we couldn't understand him right away. There were 2 lines of weather precipitation depicted on the scope; both lines parallel; one running from about PTW to the southeast to ACY; and the other running from about EMI to the southeast to GARED. The winds were out of the south about 50-80 miles; pushing the lines north. We had EWR arrivals running over JAIKE..ILENE..KEWR because they couldn't stay on the PHLBO arrival up to ARD. Eventually; this path closed up and now the EWR and EWR Satellite arrivals couldn't stay over ILENE or JAIKE; and were not staying in PHL North High's airspace any longer. The sector team decided to stop running all EWR's and EWR Sat's over JAIKE and we shut off sector 12. Departures over RBV were already shut off; and LGA arrivals were routed over SIE. Traffic Management Unit (TMU) coordinated J220 routing for some Satellite arrival aircraft. I am not sure what happened; but then TMU called and said that ZNY was going to take 2 more EWR's over the JAIKE routing (which they could not stay on anyways); but that they wanted us to run over PEEDS; then turn northbound to give to Modena in Modena's altitudes. At this time; the weather on the big board in the area showed a patch of red weather; and our scope had extreme precipitation. We knew tops were in the low to mid 300's from previous reports. The first aircraft that was doing this new 'TMU' plan was Aircraft X; which came from sector 12 descending to FL240. When the aircraft was near PEEDS; they reported the severe turbulence.There were 2 lines of storms that were staying strong and persistent moving northeast bound. Weather unit was predicting moderate to severe turbulence throughout the day. We needed to have the aircraft moved around this system a lot sooner than it was. I later found out an aircraft flying through Pinion [sector] reported severe turbulence around AML at 28000 feet then as the same system moved Northeast bound where the Aircraft X had the severe turbulence over PEEDS. At the sector; we had shut off this traffic going over JAIKE; but TMU called and said they coordinated to have 2 EWR go back over it; even knowing about the severe turbulence previously reported. Area 4 said PHL's were being re-routed into the severe turbulence earlier in the day and early evening; and IAD arrivals were getting severe turbulence earlier on the CAVLR3 arrival.We are used to the chaos and not planning from TMU/Command Center and our management teams not supporting the operation in an appropriate way because we have continuously been dealing with this at Washington Center every Thunderstorm season every year since as long as I've been here. We are used to it; we are sick of it; but we do it every day in the name of safety to the best of our ability. However; when aircraft are purposely routed into known severe turbulence that is negligent and completely unacceptable. Severe turbulence causes injuries and can lead to death. This is the line I am not willing to cross; this is enough. This needs to be fixed from the top down. This is bigger than just Washington Center; and there is complete degradation of safety culture that is in existence in the system right now. Why can't we be better? Controllers are at a loss; nothing seems to help; so we put up with it day in and day out; but nothing changes.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

445,445,445,445,9676,The following event occurred while I was working and all aircraft involved were in the PHL Bravo airspace at the time. Air Carrier Z was level at 4;000 and southbound on the downwind for Runway 35. A VFR Helicopter X; was northbound at 3;500; opposite direction to Air Carrier Z. A VFR Aircraft Y at 4;500; also northbound; following roughly the same track as Helicopter X; but about 2.5 miles behind it. All aircraft were on my frequency; and both VFR aircraft had been cleared into the Bravo by me and had been assigned their respective altitudes. In fact; a short time prior to this event; I gave Helicopter X the current altimeter; restated his altitude assignment of 3;500 and informed him were would be multiple targets opposite direction to him at 4;000.When the aircraft were southeast I issued traffic to Air Carrier Z at 11 to 12 o'clock and 3 miles; opposite direction; VFR at 3;500. He acknowledged my transmission. I can't remember if I again called traffic to Helicopter X. A very short time later Air Carrier Z advised me they had climbed due to a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA). I looked at their target and observed them at 4;400; now nose-to-nose with Aircraft Y who was at 4;500; maybe only about 3 miles apart. I told Air Carrier Z I needed him 'back down' due to opposite direction traffic at 4;500; and he said roger. Seeing Air Carrier Z had now passed Helicopter X I descended them further to help expedite his descent away from the traffic; then turned Aircraft Y to the northeast to ensure that I had the airplanes pried apart.All three aircraft were level at valid; assigned altitudes. All were separated as per requirements; and the situation was safe and under control. Due to Air Carrier Z's response to a TCAS RA; a safe situation became very dangerous and chaotic for no reason.I would recommend that the 'tolerances' or 'sensitivity' of the TCAS on this aircraft be checked. I don't see any reason a TCAS RA should occur in congested Bravo airspace due to two vertically separated aircraft passing each other. A safe situation was turned into a near disaster by the TCAS RA and the crew's response to it. Additionally; perhaps flight crews should be given discretion as to whether or not they should respond to a TCAS RA in congested Bravo airspace; when the TCAS traffic in question has been issued to them by ATC.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Approaching V1 we noticed a 747-400 on taxiway F between runway 1L and 1R waiting to cross 1R.  We reached VR approximately right behind the 400 and started our rotation.  At liftoff our aircraft started to violently buffet left and right several times.  I had to use full flight control deflection to maintain control.  Once we reached about 50 feet the aircraft became controllable and everything smoothed out.  My F/O and I surmised that the 400 was on ground control frequency and had been cleared to cross 1R shortly after we started our takeoff roll.  Since we were on different frequencies we were not aware of his status or intentions.  That aircraft obviously had to use considerable power to get rolling again and probably wanted to expeditiously cross.  We just happened to rotate right into his thrust and barely recovered.

451,451,451,451,950,We staff the BFI final monitor position when Plan A is not available. The responsibility of the Monitor position is to advise the SEA Final controller of any unplanned missed approach at BFI. The thought is that the monitor will tell the SEA Final controller; who will then break out any aircraft on the SEA final that might be impacted by the BFI go-around. I believe that this is a near-mid-air collision; or worse; waiting to happen. Due to the chain of communication that exists between the Monitor and the Final controller; I do not believe that there is sufficient time to react when a BFI arrival executes a go-around. Having experienced busy SEA Final sessions; I know that I am often so focused on my traffic; that I completely miss if someone talks to me. For example; if another controller or observer walks into my field of vision to coordinate something without waiting for a break in my traffic; I often don't fully catch what they say the first time. I foresee that this same situation will occur in a worst case scenario; when the SEA Final controller if very busy; and there is an unplanned missed approach at BFI. The Monitor should have the ability and requirement to over-key the SEA Final frequency in order to break-out affected aircraft. Instead of having the Monitor position be something of a formality to be certified on; we can wait until the end of training to certify a controller on the position.

452,452,452,452,3528,Upon arrival into CYYZ airport we were issued a descent clearance. At the time we were cruising at FL260. The clearance issued was as follows. 'Descend 240; Descend Via Arrival (Nuber2)' So we began our descent to FL240 then continued our descent VIA the Arrival as instructed. Passing FL230 controller came on and asked where we were going we were instructed to descend to FL240. My reply was correct; then we were given descend via the arrival so we were planning our first cross which was at ROKTO between 14000 and 12000. The controller responded with an explanation how they are changing phraseology in Canada and that my clearance to descend via didn't actually mean I could descend via. It meant that I was only cleared to the altitude given but was required to meet STAR restrictions in the process. The way the clearance was given and the meaning of the clearance was very confusing. We discussed for a few minutes; I voiced my concern that the way the clearance was given was very confusing. The controllers did not appear to be bothered; almost as this was not the first encounter with the confusing instructions. He simply gave me a new attitude and we proceeded in as normal. Be more specific when you issue and clearance with the DESCEND VIA phraseology. This gives the impression that the pilots are expected to descend via the instructions on the given chart. A better way to say what this controller wanted was perhaps to say; 'Descend FL240 and COMPLY with STAR'. This says right away that I am only cleared to FL240. Descend to FL240; Descend VIA the arrival - to me this means start your descent to FL240 now and then descend VIA the arrival. The difference being the first is a hard altitude and clear do not go below; the second says start down and meet restrictions per the chart.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
453,453,453,453,3923,I was working Feeder West 1 and 2 combined. At about XA38Z the first issue started. Aircraft Y checked in going too fast for the published speed at the boundary fix. UKW sector was running almost all of the aircraft faster than the published STAR speeds. The aircraft would check in with speed assignment of 310 KTS or greater than complying at the boundary fix. Most were given the comply restriction from UKW way too late; so they were not going to be able to comply. This is a daily occurrence and for us. The aircraft compress to less than 5 NM separation as soon as they enter our airspace. They were shipping aircraft late; so I had hardly any time to fix the situation. The first time it became a separation issue was at XA43Z. Aircraft X; H/B77W; was in front of Aircraft Z; Large Weight aircraft. Aircraft Z was run too fast to the boundary; so they compressed with Aircraft X. I did what I could to save the wake turbulence separation loss with speed assignments and headings. Aircraft A was the next aircraft inbound left too fast. Aircraft B was following that Aircraft A and Aircraft B was kept too fast and was less than 5 NM separation before I took the hand-off. I called UKW and told them I fixed the first separation issue; and they needed to fix the rest. The controller argued that they did have 5 MN radar separation. It was almost 4 NM separation. I didn't take the hand-off on Aircraft B hoping they would turn them out or spin them and provide proper separation. Instead; the UKW controller kept Aircraft B coming into my airspace and shipped them to me without me taking a hand-off; violating my airspace. Aircraft C was following Aircraft B; and they were less 5 NM separation too. They also kept Aircraft C coming into my airspace without a hand-off; violating my airspace. He starting turning the next couple of aircraft out to provide proper separation. He kept Aircraft D coming inside my airspace without a hand-off; violating my airspace. Aircraft D was also issued direct ZMMAN (a fix inside my airspace) without coordination; violating the LOA (Letter of Agreement). Aircraft E and Aircraft F were handed off too fast; and Aircraft G was handed off too high.Again; this situation is a daily (if not multiple times a day) occurrence with this ZFW sector. When our OS (Operations Supervisor) or CIC (Controller in Charge) call their OS or CIC; they usually aren't aware of the situation and say they'll talk to the controller. First; all ZFW arrival sectors need to have the aircraft sequenced PRIOR to our airspace boundary. They need to stop sequencing at our boundary or inside our boundary.Second; they need to have the aircraft established at the STAR speeds prior to STAR fixes at our boundary.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
454,454,454,454,6085,I had to vector out Aircraft X on the arrival into ZZZ for spacing. I turned him back towards ZZZZ intersection and descended him to 14000 feet. I had taken a point out on a jump aircraft climbing up VFR to 13000 feet to drop jumpers near ZZZZ intersection. I had asked a controller to stop his aircraft at 16000 feet so I can get 2 arrivals down to 14000 feet. I pointed out an aircraft to the controller climbing out of ZZZ1. I gave Aircraft X cross ZZZZ intersection at 14000 feet (He read back 12000 feet garbled but readable on playback). While he was reading that back I noticed that the other sector had begun descending his [aircraft] to cross ZZZ VOR at 14000 feet. I immediately told him to stop that plane at 15000 feet (He apologized later). I noticed it took Aircraft X almost 10 miles to begin his turn to ZZZZ intersection. A few minutes later I saw Aircraft X data block update to 13800 feet. Next update was 13400 feet about 7 miles from ZZZZ intersection. I verified he was crossing ZZZZ intersection at 14000 feet. He said 'no; YOU cleared us to 12000 feet'. My clearance on playback was extremely clear and was ZZZZ intersection at 14000 feet. I issued a 30 degree left turn and climb to 14000 feet and issued the traffic 1 o'clock 10 miles a jump aircraft. 4 miles later I saw Aircraft X turning right to join the arrival. I told him I gave that 30 degrees prior to ZZZZ intersection to ensure distance between him and the jump aircraft who was now at altitude and jumpers could be in the air (currently Aircraft X was still below 13000 feet). I finally got prompt compliance from Aircraft X.These jump aircraft should not be allowed to drop on an arrival route into a major airport; or should be restricted to 11000 feet. The arrival descends to 12000 feet at ZZZ VOR. Also; I recommend this incident be 'pulled' and a Falcon Radar replay made to be distributed to the airline safety groups to show how lack of prompt compliance could lead to catastrophic problems.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
455,455,455,455,230,Air Carrier X was a BWI departure climbing out on the TERPZ2 SID. He was assigned FL230 and was climbing out of 11;500 FT as he turned south on the TERPZ2 at WONCE. Air Carrier Y was a DCA departure climbing out on RADAR vectors approximately 10 DME NW of DCA out of 5;600 FT. I issued Air Carrier Y a climb to 17;000 FT and a heading of 300; which he read back. Approximately 1-1/2 minutes later; I saw Air Carrier X was still only at 11;800 FT and Air Carrier Y was converging; climbing out of 10;600 FT. I assigned Air Carrier Y 12;000 FT. I then called traffic to Air Carrier X; who reported Air Carrier Y in sight and advised he was getting an RA and was climbing. I told Air Carrier X to maintain visual separation from Air Carrier Y and he said he would. Air Carrier Y then advised me he was responding to an RA with the aircraft off his right (Air Carrier X). I asked Air Carrier Y to repeat; he said he was in the middle of an RA. I told Air Carrier Y to climb to 17;000 FT when he was finished. I was aware of Air Carrier X's altitude when I climbed Air Carrier Y to 17;000 FT. I believed the 300 heading would keep Air Carrier Y separated from Air Carrier X laterally. I also felt the 6;000 FT difference in their altitudes when I issued Air Carrier Y a climb would assist in maintaining separation. While not a solid technique; I had no concern that the aircraft would close such a large vertical distance in such a short time. However; Air Carrier X leveled off at 11;500 FT and proceeded to only climb 300 FT over a 90 second time period just before the incident. By the time I recognized his low altitude; there was not enough time to prevent the loss of separation. On a human factors note; I believe that my knowledge and experience with the (old) TERPZ1 Departure out of BWI contributed to this incident as well. On the TERPZ1 HAFNR transition; aircraft did not fly over JIMME after WONCE; but instead turned more southerly towards HAFNR. On the TERPZ2; all aircraft fly over JIMME after WONCE; which is a more southwesterly track; before continuing on the various transitions. This failure to process the wider track of Air Carrier X (leading to greater time needed for Air Carrier Y to cross the projected path of Air Carrier X) gave me a false sense that Air Carrier Y would pass in front of Air Carrier X with lateral separation.Recommendation 1) Use vertical separation when climbing across the path of another aircraft and the possibility exists that there won't be 3 miles lateral separation. 2) Be vigilant of the new track of the TERPZ2 HAFNR transition. 3) Increase scan rate to more quickly recognize when aircraft fail to perform as expected; Air Carrier X climbed a total of 300 FT over a 90 second period just before the incident.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
456,456,456,456,4492,Our flight was on approach to ORD Runway 28R. It was visual conditions at airport. The First Officer was flying the approach that had rain occurring from shoreline to near WILLT. Approach Control cleared us for the ILS and reported that the LOC was reported as a little erratic. We continued and LOC seemed to move some much like [Runway] 4R LOC did at ORD for some time. At 4;000 FT the First Officer disconnected the autopilot to keep the LOC roll to a minimum. Prior to WILLT glideslope had some displacement; but seemed reasonable. The glideslope was stable as we approached WILLT and as we crossed WILLT with glideslope tracking right on I noticed our altitude over WILLT off by 200 FT. Had we continued to follow the glideslope guidance we would have got even lower on the approach. As it was we broke out and saw the airport and flew visually in from that point. As we were landing we heard an aircraft behind us commenting on glideslope indications as well. Once we got to ground we reported the anomaly. ATC indicated that they had a Heavy on the south side of the east end of [Runway] 28R that they were going to move soon and that they believed it was the cause of the beam error. Once at the gate I again called ground to suggest that a LOC only Approach should be used until this could be addressed. The airport had reconfigured shortly before we arrived and there were a lot of aircraft lined up on the north side of the runway as well as the big one we saw on the south side. Don't know if that was a factor but it definitely appeared that we were getting some glideslope information that wasn't correct. It appeared all controllers had some knowledge of a problem but thought it was limited to the LOC only. Suggestions; it was busy on the Approach and we do deal with signal strength issues but almost exclusively on LOC's or VOR's. First thought would be to go to an RNAV approach when these conditions exist or are expected to exist. The Minimums are higher; but with weather like we had it would have been a non-event. I have seen this signal wavering on the other end of [Runway] 28R and attributed it to a large aircraft at approach end of [Runway] 10L.

We were eventually cleared for a Visual Approach to Runway 16R following traffic. Denver Approach called out traffic for the parallel Runway at our seven o'clock at a lower altitude and stated they had a 40 knot overtake. I asked if we could increase our speed to avoid the other aircraft overtaking us and I stated we would most likely get a TCAS RA on the aircraft. ATC said we were four miles in trail of the traffic and could increase slightly. We increased 10 knots; but as anticipated; we received a TCAS RA. We complied with the RA and ATC broke us off the approach. We were vectored for a subsequent approach and landed on Runway 16R. This cost 800 pounds of fuel and approximately 10 minutes time.This is the third TCAS RA involving Runways 16L and 16R I have experienced in the last few months; one of which resulted in a divert due to weather that impacted the field during the go around and re-sequencing.

I advised the ATC desk what happened and asked if they would like to be on a call with me to the Denver TRACON. They declined. I contacted the Denver TRACON to discuss the handling my flight received and inquired why an aircraft was allowed to overtake us. We had a long discussion with the end result of me being told this is basically how Denver TRACON does business.I did not select TA Only on the TCAS as I feel turning off this safety system defeats the purpose of the system. I also do not feel we should turn it to TA only to accommodate the way ATC is handling our aircraft on these runways as a normal means of business.

460,460,460,460,10671,Shortly before GRAMM on the RIIVR2 arrival into LAX; we were issued a 'descend via' clearance and cleared for the ILS 25L approach. We were also told to plan on holding an airspeed of 280 knots 'well past RIIVR.' That being said; I hard coded 280 knots on the descent page as well as 250 knots at each waypoint below 10;000 to FUELR (where the FMC usually plans a slower speed and where ATC typically slow us back from 250 knots).We were then issued 250 knots in the vicinity of RIIVR; which left us high on the profile that I hard coded based on the 280 knots comment above. Then; descending through 11;000 feet outside of KRAIN; we were issued 210 knots.I initially waited a few seconds as we were approaching 10;000 with a planned level off and I did not want to execute a speed command right at an altitude level off. However; the airplane was not slowing fast enough (even with speed brakes) and I was concerned that we were gaining on the traffic ahead; so I entered and executed the speed change. Shortly after I entered the 210 knots into the FMC; I looked at the FMA to confirm we were still in VNAV PATH. To my surprise; the pitch mode changed to CWS P and the airplane began descending below the 10;000 foot altitude restriction between LUVYN and KRAIN (speed was at 250 and thus ok).I immediately disconnected the autopilot to recover; but we had already descend 150 below the minimum altitude. I hand flew the level off; re-engaged the autopilot and reselected VNAV. At that point; the VNAV started reducing the airspeed (possibly because we were high and past the newly calculated descent point). I again turned the autopilot off and hand flew the remainder of the approach.As I reflect back on the flight; I am somewhat at a loss for what I could have done differently. I have flown that approach many times; in different airplanes; and feel quite comfortable with the arrival and approach. I do occasionally have trust issues with the Smiths FMC on the 737 as it seems like it gets confused with either too many inputs or inputs at critical times.In this case; neither the First Officer nor myself recall bumping the control wheel and I believe the autopilot must have 'given up' when it concluded that it could not keep up with the commands. Though I have been on this airplane 1 1/2 years; I have never seen the autopilot quietly revert to CWS P with no physical contact or apparent reason. We did not receive a 'Des Path Unachievable' nor did the MCP revert to VNAV SPD or LVL CHG. While I believe my VVM and cross checking were heightened at this time; it all happened at a particularly busy time at 10;000 feet while also double chiming the cabin and the First Officer preparing for the Approach Checklist.All this being said; I believe this situation could have been avoided had we not been issued two speed changes; in a short period of time; after being told to expect to keep the speed up on the arrival; all while trying to descend via the arrival in an aircraft that does not have the Speed Intervene button. As a final piece of irony; the First Officer and I were just discussing the recent safety report that featured an ATC section on this very topic of close-in clearance changes on complex descend via STARs!However; I plan on being much more vigilant on this arrival in the future and will likely consider Vertical Speed with incremental altitude resets on the MCP if I get more than one speed or altitude change during a busy part of the arrival/approach.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I brought it up and read it. It was a PC12; CMH.DQN.CVG.RDSTN2.KLOU; requesting 140. CMH departures are vectored westbound by CMH Approach and then handed off to LTL LO (Sector 31); so as to stay clear of my sector. If this aircraft were given direct CVG; it would stay within my airspace. However; direct CVG would conflict with CVG arrivals; of which I had one; CRJ2 ...TIGRR1.KCVG descending to FL200. I then dropped the limited data block; thinking that LTL LO would keep the aircraft westbound in their climb shelf; staying out of my airspace. However; I soon noticed the PC12's limited Data Block flying southwest bound and then climbing out of 104 into my airspace. I once again brought the full Data Block to see what was going on. I called LTL LO and told them that the PC12 was point out approved. LTL LO responded by saying that they called Sector 23 and someone answered saying point out approved. I told him that I never received a call. I then asked the sector next to me; PKB LO; if they took a point out on the PC12. The PKB LO D-Side said that 31 called and started talking right away. The PKB LO D-Side said that 31 did not let him identify who he was. The PC12 was in PKB LO's shelf proceeding westbound. So; the PKB LO D-Side said point out approved. The RADAR trainer at PKB LO then said he noticed the PC12 begin tracking southwest bound. He then looked on my RADAR scope and noticed that I had pulled the PC12's full data block up on my RADAR scope. The PC12 was climbed to 140 by LTL LO and given direct CVG. I still had my CVG arrival; the CRJ2. The CRJ2 was faster than the PC12; so I descended the CRJ2 to 150. When the CRJ2 was 5 NM past the PC12; I descended him to 110. No separation was lost. Recommendation; because of the excessive number of sectors in our area; our VSCS is not always operating as normal areas do. Our PIK LO sector is not even physically located in our area because we do not have enough room. Therefore; PIK LO almost always stays combined at PKB LO; and YRK LO almost always stays combined with CMH LO. If on the rare occasion that YRK LO or PIK LO need to open; we open up YRK LO with PIK LO combined with it. In order to do this; the Supervisor has to reconfigure the VSCS to activate YRK LO. However; as I previously mentioned; YRK LO rarely opens up. We are unable to manually plug into YRK LO and forward the phone calls to CMH LO. So; the calls from YRK LO must be transferred to PKB LO (from many months ago). There is no way to tell visually unless the Supervisor reconfigures the area's VSCS maps. LTL LO said they dialed 23 for a point out to YRK and this dialed into the PKB LO D-Side. LTL LO did not allow the PKB LO D-Side to identify himself; talking immediately giving the point out of the PC12. If the LTL LO Controller had let PKB LO identify himself; he would have responded; 'PKB and PIK LO D-Side.' So LTL LO thought that by just dialing 23 they pointed out the PC12 to YRK LO. They were incorrect. The PKB LO D-Side was not wrong in accepting the point-out because the aircraft was within their climb box airspace. My recommendation is for LTL LO to slow down and let the receiving caller identify himself. LTL LO's area also needs a review as to how our VSCS is limited. We also have a VSCS limitation on our ultra high sector when it combines in the evening. Traffic is slow; there is no need to rush through procedures. Let everyone speak as they should for proper phone call transmissions; and the process will reveal what is needed.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
462,462,462,462,7924,During the ZZZZZ X Arrival; a late clearance was issued and believed to have been to 'Expect ZZZZZ1 at 250 knots.' That 'Expect' clearance was read back by the Pilot Flying (First Officer) due to the fact that the Pilot Monitoring (Captain) was speaking to the flight attendants on the interphone. After passing ZZZZZ1; ATC asked to verify that we were at 250 knots; the First Officer/PM responded that we were awaiting the expect 250 knots clearance. The ATC Controller made reference to the fact that he was wearing a face mask and the clearance may have been miss-understood. The Captain returned from speaking with the flight attendants and the First Officer briefed him on the miss-understanding of the 'expect 250 knot' clearance. The aircraft was slowed to 250 knots and the flight continued on the ZZZZZ X Arrival uneventfully.Communication with ATC can be difficult enough.

463,463,463,463,4033,While being vectored by Approach Control on an easterly heading approximately 12 miles northeast of destination we received a GPWS alert of 'Caution; Obstacle' followed by a warning 'Obstacle; Obstacle; Pull Up.' The alert was generated by a tethered balloon in Restricted Airspace. I have flown into this airport numerous times and this event did not take us by surprise. We had briefed this restricted area earlier in the flight and both had terrain displayed on our NDs. As we arrived in the terminal area; I pointed out the obstacle on the ND and explained how we would most likely be vectored into the airport. The First Officer and I were both well aware that we needed a turn and conveyed that to Approach Control; who was vectoring another aircraft on a left base. Immediately thereafter; we received the caution and prior to receiving a vector we received the warning. It was obvious the terrain avoidance maneuver would not be appropriate in this situation. The autopilot and autothrottles were disconnected and a hard right turn at approximately 40-degree angle of bank was used. During the turn; ATC told us to fly heading 150. I had already overshot that heading by 20 degrees and immediately corrected back to the 150 degree heading. I can't say whether or not we had entered the restricted area. We were then vectored to an uneventful visual approach and landing.On the ground; I contacted Approach Control by telephone and we discussed the situation. The Controller said he had the tethered balloon displayed on his screen but was delaying the vector because of spacing with the aircraft on left base but was just about to turn us. He stated adding to his predicament was the fact that we were co altitude with the other aircraft. We were assigned that altitude by the Controller he had just relieved after asking for lower to get out of the bumpy cumulus clouds. I explained our warning system to him and we discussed steps that may be taken in the future to prevent a situation such as this.

464,464,464,464,4662,Tower requested if we could take a turn to the Final Approach Fix (FAF) then a short final visual approach. We were on a heading and at 2000 feet. We agreed. The controller had us at 180 knots and turned us inside (not to) the FAF and cleared us for the Visual Approach. Needless to say it was chaotic; but safe. We probably should have denied the request; especially because it was at night; but we knew we could do it safely but very rushed. Reminds me of old school slam dunks; and we know now the longer way is just plain more safe. This is twice in two approaches into this airport that a controller slammed dunked us onto final. Last time we were coming from the north and they cleared us from 7000 feet directly onto final.The only reason we made it was because we were slightly ready by being slow and having flaps out; and we immediately put gear down. Both times we were on the edge of going around but became stable within parameters. Point being; both approaches could have been much more safe and steady with some pre planning on the controllers part. I'm writing this to hopefully encourage them to work with us a little more; and not need us to push planes and pilots to full capacity to comply with their requests. I am certain I won't accept a Visual Approach at night if they ever turn us inside the FAF again; and doubtful I'd take that slam dunk either.

The operation was running just fine until our supervisor decided to come to the Tower and start telling Controllers how to run the traffic. One example was the supervisor telling the Controller working Local Control to issue Line Up and Wait (LUAW) even though we can't see the aircraft. I was working Clearance Delivery/Flight data and stood up and said 'you can't do that'. The supervisor said 'I don't care' and told Local Control to do it again. I again spoke out and was told again 'I don't care' and the Supervisor told Local Control again to put the aircraft in position.I then said 'ok you're blatantly breaking the LUAW rules'. At this time I told him you could only do it if the runway was advertised as a departure only runway. He again said 'I don't care'. After a minute I was told to change the ATIS to accurately reflect the operation. During this time the Supervisor decided to take all the arrivals to Runway 2L and all the departures to Runway 2R. Meanwhile the RVRs for Runway 2R dropped below departure minimums. Then the Supervisor decided to take all the departures that couldn't accept Runway 2R back across the airport while still having zero visibility in the tower mind you; over to Runway 2L.

467,467,467,467,4897,Upon checking on with ATL approach; we were told to expect Runway 9R. Our initial brief was for Runway 8L because that is the typical Runway assignment when flying the CHPPR arrival. The FO (First Officer) briefed the Runway change. A subsequent Approach Controller cleared us to descend via the arrival and also that we were cleared for the ILS PRM [Precision Runway Monitor] Runway 9R approach. We had to again brief for the PRM approach because they were not advertising PRM's in the ATIS. We got a little behind the airplane and approach asked to start our descent and then handed us off to Tower. I can't recall if we were given a speed to maintain to the 5-mile fix. I checked on with ATL Tower and we were cleared to land on approximately 8-10 mile final. I recall the Approach Controller on the monitor frequency asking the aircraft behind us to slow to final approach speed. Less than a minute later; at about 1;200 feet. AGL; Tower instructed us to discontinue the approach; climb to 4;000 feet; and gave us headings. We maintained normal and stable approach at all times. We were told that the reason was because we slowed to our final approach speed at around a 6-mile final. I assumed then that we had insufficient spacing with the aircraft behind us. We were vectored for the same approach which concluded normally.We had an apparent loss of spacing on final approach which resulted in ATC cancelling our approach clearance.

I was working Local Control and a CRJ2 was inbound. I issued him the Braking Action on Runway XXL; which had been reported as FAIR by a SW4; 30 minutes prior. I then reissued the current MU's. The CRJ2 landed without incident. I told the aircraft to turn left Taxiway Bravo and contact Ground. The CRJ2 came to a full stop on the runway and then made the right turn onto Bravo Taxiway. He contacted Ground and reported joining Alpha. Ground gave him taxi instructions via Alpha; Foxtrot with braking action report. The CRJ2 was unable to make the turn and continued straight ahead onto Bravo. Ground issued Braking Action Nil. Aircraft ended up perpendicular on the taxiway; due to the ice.

471,471,471,471,9000,In my duties as a Quality Control Specialist I investigated a Mandatory Occurrence Report (MOR). The MOR was correctly classified as 'Emergency - VFR pilot in or trapped on top of clouds'. The narrative of the MOR indicated that the pilot had been issued the Brasher Warning informing the pilot of a possible pilot deviation; and the pilot was given the phone number of the ARTCC watch desk. The regional Quality Control office requested an audio file of the event; which I attached to the MOR. In addition to the audio file; I created a Falcon 3 (Radar Data replay) with voice to document the event. My initial reading of the MOR (which I believed was a chronological narrative of events) indicated that the Brasher Warning was issued to the aircraft after his safe arrival at one of the airports suggested by the controller. When I reviewed the radar and audio data; I discovered the controller appears to have been directed to read the Brasher Warning to the pilot while he was still attempting to descend below the cloud layers and safely proceed to one of the destinations suggested by the controller. I believe that management's directive to the controller to issue the Brasher Warning to an aircraft encountering weather difficulty; and was being treated as an emergency situation by the controller; resulted in a severe safety of flight issue.

Sometime around OYSTY; Approach cleared us to 2000 feet; slowed us to 210; and cleared us for the approach. We were in IMC. We descended to be outside JASPO (the FAF) at 2000. This resulted in us getting down to 2000 prior to 15 NM from MSY (outside the Class B); doing about 210 knots. When we got to RAYOP; Approach said; you are reentering the Class B. Oh. Whoops. Class B excursion. This whole Class B thing has become such an issue that I don't even know what is right anymore. Clearly we were speeding below the lateral limits. However; I was under the impression that the Class B excursions have been occurring during VISUAL approaches; where the pilots are operating on their own recognizance; and descend too soon. In THIS case; we under ATC control; on an instrument approach; and in IMC. The controller gave us a clearance below the floor of the Class B; and at a high speed. I didn't think they were supposed to do that; especially since we were at an ATC assigned speed too high for that position. Are we really supposed to be trapping this type of ATC error too; without the tools to do so? So maybe he did that on purpose; I just don't understand what's going on. And if he did; he did not warn us that we might go out the bottom; and he didn't tell us when we did so.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
473,473,473,473,2662,Arrival into SAN was night VFR. Approach procedure had changed several times. We had been filed for Shamu 1; were cleared the Bayvu 3 for a 27 localizer. We re- requested the Shamu 1 with an ILS to 9 approach. ILS to 9 was denied due to [airport] construction. We were then given vectors to a 27 LOC. We were on a right down wind to 27 and given a vector that would intercept the localizer just outside of the IAF (REEBO) on a diagonal intercept course. As we were passing abeam the runway; ATC inquired if we had the runway insight. We did and they cleared us for a visual approach. We were about 4000 feet (estimate) and descending. The REEBO intercept alt is 2000 feet and my plan was to square the base turn to arrive at REEBO wings level inbound at 2000 feet. In order to do this I had to turn left slightly in order to have enough separation to turn back into REEBO and be wings level for the crossing and descent. I started my descent to 2000 feet. There was terrain to the left of us; which we both saw and talked about. We passed the highest terrain to the right and turned base leg at 2000 feet. There was never a GPWS terrain warning in the cockpit; ATC never issued a terrain warning; nor was there ever a 1000 foot or 500 foot radar altimeter indication. At some point in the approach we did get the 2500 foot altitude radar call out. We had all terrain in sight; talked about it; did not feel uncomfortable and did not receive any cockpit or ATC warnings.

474,474,474,474,5458,I assigned Aircraft X a discreet squawk code and identified aircraft northwest of OMN.  Pilot request for a full stop at DAB.  Issued traffic to Aircraft X which pilot reported in sight.  I issued pattern entry instructions to 7L at DAB and advised Aircraft X to maintain VFR at 1;600.   Arrival was at an adjacent scope and I was handing off my VFR arrivals at 1;600 feet.  I had two other VFR arrivals ahead of Aircraft X; two VFR aircraft holding over the OMN VOR @ 020 and 025.  I had a VFR point-out from M-ar scope over XFL leaving my airspace and a VFR arrival to OMN crossing west of DAB at 021.  Aircraft X reported that previous issued traffic had turned back toward him and that he had made an 'evasive' maneuver.  I was giving instructions for the OMN arrival when Aircraft X advised that he had a 'close call' with Aircraft Y.  When I returned my attention to Aircraft X and saw VFR target indicating 016 (unverified; limited data block) west of Aircraft X moving west.  As the pilot had reported the traffic and target was moving away; I only acknowledged with; 'Roger'.   Moments later Aircraft X advised he 'had a near miss.'  I advised the FLM.At the time the report was made I was unsure if Aircraft Y was the previous issued traffic or a new target.  After being advised that air traffic was looking into the NMAC; I reviewed the radar playback and saw that Aircraft Y had departed OMN and started a climb once he was clear of the DAB Class Charlie.  The playback revealed that a conflict alert had gone off (very common in DAB airspace with the concentration of aircraft); but I did not recall hearing it; and subsequently had not issued a traffic alert. After reviewing my pref sets for the radar position; I determined that my audible alarm was at a lower setting (2); and my LDB's (Limited Data Blocks) intensities were set much lower than my full data blocks.  While I had not previously had a problem with these lower settings; I intend to adjust to higher levels on both and be sure to check them each time I sign onto position.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
475,475,475,475,4971,This is a situation that I witnessed; and do not think a [report] was filed. I feel it pertinent to bring up. Aircraft X was flying at the lowest assignable attitude (16000 feet) over the Sierra Nevada. The Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) in that area is 15200 feet. The aircraft experienced serious downdrafts; and lost over 1200 feet of altitude in only 2-3 radar returns. The aircraft asked for help; and the controller working the sector initially responded with 'you're below my MIA; I can't vector you below the MIA.' The controller asked if he was getting icing; but the pilot said negative. When he finally gave suggested headings; the controller was saying things like maybe this heading or maybe that heading. Nothing concrete that would invoke any sort of confidence in the pilot. I feel that the controller did a terrible job helping the pilot. He did not issue a low altitude alert or even find out if he was IMC until 10 minutes after the issue started. It took another controller to make him ask the pilot if he was IMC; and issue a safety alert. The controller gave a much better service to another aircraft that was not in an emergency situation than he gave this aircraft. When the Operations Manager came in the area he asked if the pilot was getting carb icing (a very good question); and the controllers response was 'he is not getting icing.' The controller NEVER asked the pilot if he was getting carb icing. While this was probably not a contributing factor; this was pertinent information that could have helped the pilot get more power out of his engine. This particular controller has many difficulties working normal traffic; and a situation like this put him over the edge. This was a very unsafe situation; and I feel that if the pilot had not kept his cool he may have crashed. I feel that situations like these; that do not show up as a loss of separation; airspace violation; or incident are not looked at very seriously at our facility. Management filed an incident report but it was very vague and did not properly narrate the situation. I don't even think management listened to the tape. I do not want someone to be penalized; but I think we need to engage this controller; and offer him more training on these types of situations. In fact; every controller; including myself should be 'called out' if they do not provide enough service to an aircraft in need. We do run simulations with scenarios like this during our 'recovery' training; but I feel this exact situation should be re-created.

476,476,476,476,1773,As we were returning to SJC; Oakland Center gave us Direct TROXX; which I recognized as a waypoint on the SILCN ONE arrival. We pulled the Jeppesen chart up on the Multifunction Display (MFD) to begin our arrival planning. Center asked us for our best forward speed (.68 mach); and we heard other planes being asked to slow for the arrival. While descending but still in the flight levels we were given the SILCN ONE arrival as expected; and told to descend via the arrival.Between SILCN and VLLEY; we were given the 'West transition'. The Jeppesen plate was zoomed in enough that the EAST and West Transition notes were off the screen. Since the transition through BAXBY and APLLE was to the west of the one through GUUYY to KLIDE; we both assumed that was the one we were to take. On the other hand; from previous experience into San Jose; I knew that KLIDE was the normal way to get to RW 31L; which is what we expected. We discussed the situation; and I assumed that we were being taken off the normal arrival because we were slower than the people behind us. Neither of us felt comfortable about this concept and after passing BAXBY we started questioning our choice; especially after hearing the other planes that had been asked to slow down also being given the West Transition. At this point the Pilot Not Flying (PNF) called NORCAL (we'd been transferred to NORCAL earlier) and asked it we should be on the transition to KLIDE or the one to ZORSA. The reply was; of course; the one to KLIDE - NORCAL then gave us direct KLIDE.We could easily have continued on the wrong transition; and followed an inappropriate descent profile as well as the wrong course. In retrospect; we should have clarified the transition question before arriving at VLLEY by asking if the transition was the one through KLIDE or ZORSA; and should have checked the zoom on the arrival chart to make sure we had seen the entire arrival. From a human factors perspective; calling a transition that is on the west side of the chart the EAST Transition; and on the East side of the chart the WEST Transition is asking for problems.

477,477,477,477,6079,OGG RWY 2 was closed by NOTAM at XA:45. At XA:48 Aircraft X called the R3 controller who was working all of the HCF enroute airspace combined requesting departure from [OGG]. The tower closed at XA:00 so the airport was uncontrolled. The controller asked me what to tell Aircraft X. I advised her to issue a release for departure but to advise Aircraft X that RWY 2/20 closed at XA:45. While she did that I attempted to call the airport operator; the State of Hawaii; Department of Transportation; and Airports Division to clarify the status of RWY 2/20. All of the phone numbers I called were answered by voicemail but I was able to reach Kahului Airport Security who advised no operations personnel were on duty. The R3 controller advised me that Aircraft X said they had spoken with the airport contractor doing paving work at the airport and that they had arranged for a delay in the runway closure through them and provided a phone number. I contacted the contractor; and they advised me they were waiting for Aircraft X to depart before starting work. I requested that they continue to delay starting their work on the runway while I attempted to get in contact with the airport operator and my on call [manager]. I called the [manager] on call and explained the situation. They said to release the departure as long as the contractor said they were clear of the runway. I disagreed strongly and still do but complied with the direction and had the R3 controller issue the release. I think what we did was wrong and that FAA does not determine the status of a runway that we do not own; only the airport operator has that ability. It's my belief that the contractor is not a proxy for the operator as there could be more than one type of work being conducted by more than one contractor during the time the operator has closed the runway.Regardless of whether or not what we did was legal the situation is certainly not good. The last time this happened a month or two ago the aircraft gave up and went back to the gate and the passengers were forced to spend an extra day on Maui. This runway work has been ongoing for years and if there are going to be departures so close to the runway closure times the State should keep personnel on duty to ensure that they runway stays open long enough for them to depart or some type of mechanism needs to be put in place to keep the FAA advised of the status of the runways there.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
478,478,478,478,6468,There were multiple aircraft in holding patterns over OCN VORTAC. Some were VFR and some were IFR. When the data blocks would pass each other the digital targets would jump and move to the position of the other aircraft. While this was happening I took control of an IFR aircraft with the assumption that they were now VFR based off their position. I incorrectly gave an IFR aircraft an altitude restriction that would provide 500 feet with another IFR aircraft. I did so thinking the first aircraft was VFR. The two aircraft were both in holding over OCN VOR one at 2500 feet and the other aircraft at 3000 feet. There has been a lot of reports about the new STARS equipment and the jumping targets.

479,479,479,479,1871,On the TRUPS RNAV STAR into DCA in an MD-80 we were in moderate icing conditions with a tailwind. The speed brakes were full aft in a max effort to comply with the crossings and speeds on the arrival. Approaching TRUPS we understood the Controller to tell us to maintain 11;000 feet and 290 KTS until TRUPS. Then; instead of tracking to LETZZ to cross at 8;000 feet; we were cleared TRUPS direct to RLLLL to continue on the arrival. After passing TRUPS we slow down to be at 250 KTS to pass through 10;000 feet to cross RLLLL at 6;000 feet. As we are slowing through about 260 KTS and approximately 10;600 feet the Controller says 'What did I tell you?' And he asked us about three times; 'What did I tell you?' For that question; we had no answer; but we responded that we were slowing to 250 KTS to descend below 10;000 feet on the arrival. He then explained we were cleared to maintain 11;000 feet and 290 KTS. We start to climb and he said 'Never mind; you are cleared to 6;000 feet.' We do not remember reading back such a clearance as he describes. He very well could have given us that clearance; but we did not comprehend it nor did we acknowledge it as he intended us to fly it.The TRUPS Arrival in to DCA is a difficult approach and on an MD-80 it requires both crew members' full attention. It is difficult to switch gears when [what you are already doing] is taking max effort. When the Controller changed three parameters of the arrival with one clearance; [his intent was; apparently;] misunderstood. Everything happened very quickly. The work load is too much at that time to process and implement three changes without making sure the crew understands exactly what the Controller wants. My first suggestion would be not to allow the [MD-80 to fly the] TRUPS arrival. If the TRUPS stays; my second suggestion would be; if the controller needs to make changes to the arrival; preface the clearance with; 'disregard speed and altitude on the arrival; I now need to you to maintain 11;000 feet and 290 KTS until further advised.' The clearance needs to be very direct; in reference to the [published constraints of the] arrival because; up until that moment; we are [at max workload to do] what we had briefed and planned in order to fly it as published.

My First Officer called traffic in sight and the Controller said; 'Maintain visual with Airbus; follow to airport; cleared visual 7R. My First Officer astutely replied that we could NOT maintain the visual; as both aircraft were entering IMC; and we did not have the airport in sight. The Final Controller told us to then maintain 4;000 FT and cancel approach clearance. We then were vectored off the localizer to the south and then west and were then instructed to 'climb 5;000 FT and fly heading 270 vector to re-sequence'.Just a few seconds later; we received a TA with traffic at two o'clock and 5 miles at our altitude.

481,481,481,481,140,While approaching DCA the weather began dropping making both advertised approaches to Runway 19 and 15 unlikely options. I contacted Dispatch via ACARS requesting possible coordination with ATC to land on Runway 1 with a small tailwind. I checked landing performance data for both Runway 19; 15 and 1. Runway 15 would be very tight at 5;195 feet (5;204 length) using auto brakes 2. Runway 19 left us with more margin; but 25 feet less on minimums. Runway 15 had its PAPI NOTAMed out as well. While Dispatch worked with ATC we briefed the TRUPS4 Arrival and LDA-Z 19 as I felt it was the safest course of action and advertised as available. When we checked on with Potomac Approach; they advised us to expect RNAV (GPS) 15 and after 'FRDMM; fly heading 120. I asked the First Officer to request ILS 1; as the latest at ATIS had the WX at 700 BKN and below minimums for both 19 and 15. Approach advised a small delay would be in order; but expect ILS 1. I asked the First Officer to load ILS 1 in the FMC; while I pulled it up on my Jeppesen Pro X. When loading the transition for ILS 1 the FMC drops the north side transition (Runway 19) and loads the south transition for Runway 1. 'FRDMM' is replaced by 'LETZZ' as the North and South transitions diverge at 'TRUPS.' Our last clearance was to fly 120 heading at 'FRDMM;' which was no longer on our transition. As we crossed 'TRUPS' I began to fly the transition for Runway 1; while the First Officer queried ATC if they would like us to fly 120 heading at 'LETZZ' now instead. ATC advised to just fly the north transition. Initially this terminology was confusing and I asked the First Officer to clarify what he meant; 'The north Runway 1 transition or the North segment of the transition.' ATC confirmed the Runway 1 transition. While it seemed to go as well as could be expected; we were told to 'Expect' Runway 1; but not actually cleared to fly that transition until clarifying while joining it. We caught it very early and I estimate we were within 1-1.5 miles of the track either way. We continued inbound and made an eventful approach and landing to Runway 1. During our flight debrief I became a point of discussion and felt it best to report the situation. The workload was high at the time and ATC was also very busy; so it added to the complexity of communicating. In the end; I believe we were doing what ATC expected; but may not have been cleared for the south (Runway 1 transition) when he advised 'expect Runway 1'.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
482,482,482,482,568,I was with my student holding short at taxiway D for a Runway (12R) crossing clearance to go back to the ramp after the last landing on 12L. It was a busy morning and soon there was another aircraft pulled up behind us. We had to wait for sometime; about 7 minutes or so while multiple aircraft taking off and landing on the runway. But then the Ground Controller started transmission 'No need to respond; I acknowledge your patience.' While I didn't see any more traffic on the final; I started moving before realizing it wasn't a crossing instruction. I pulled up and heard the controller stopping the aircraft behind us then subsequently instructed us to expedite crossing the runway. I stopped on the taxiway cleared of 12R until the Ground Controller called us again. He asked what happened and was answered with apologies that we misunderstood. Then we got the taxi instruction to the ramp. I may have got little complacent with the operations at this airport and didn't pay much attention to different instructions. The phrases like 'Thank you for patience' were with runway crossing clearance in many cases. And often I heard 'no need to respond' whenever a controller makes multiple aircraft crossing a runway at the same time. But they never should be confused or assumed to be a clearance.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
483,483,483,483,4678,I had just plugged in to the Final Monitor position to get the brief when only seconds into the brief I heard an Air Carrier on about a 7 mile final to Runway XXL declare an emergency. I took the position and heard the Local Controller send another Air Carrier in front of the emergency Air Carrier around; the Local Controller also cancelled the approach clearance on the Air Carrier behind the emergency Air Carrier and had him track the localizer; I believe he was issued 2;000 FT. I advised the Supervisor of the emergency and asked if we wanted to run the aircraft down the final and over the airport or pull them out; and we agreed to the pull outs. I coordinated with Local that I would pull the remaining aircraft off the final; the first two aircraft that I pulled out eastbound. There was traffic behind him inbound to Runway XXC and I decided to turn him 30 degrees left at 5;000 FT to maintain separation but putting him over the 4;000 FT traffic I just pulled out. At this time I started to get the feeling there was a communication breakdown. I believe a Final Controller and a Feeder Controller were not aware that Runway XXL would close after the emergency landed. There were low IMC conditions at the time and very strong winds aloft making control even more difficult. I vectored the three aircraft to the downwind and changed them to the Arrival Controller's frequency for re-sequence. I had limited time to talk since I was on the Local frequency and they also had the emergency going. The Feeder Controller; not aware or not sure why the aircraft were coming off the final; continued to vector towards a normal approach point which overwhelmed the Arrival Controller. The aircraft all appeared to be vertically separated but one of them handed off from the Feeder was slow in the descent. By the time the Arrival Controller realized he was not level at 6;000 FT; it was too late. The Supervisor in charge was competent. I have respect for the Supervisor. That said there was a complete meltdown with communication; coordination and guidance. When a runway closes in the middle of a rush; someone needs to make all the players aware; plan a suitable solution and voice this to all concerned. The pullouts were a major factor in this scenario but had they gone thru the airport and had an error on the Departure side; the obvious cause would have been because they weren't pulled out. Another factor conducive to this event was all the runway changes the Feeder had to issue. Initially they were going to [Runway] XXL with overflow only to [Runway] XXC. The Feeder Controller; who had some going to [Runway] XXC changed them back to [Runway] XXL. When he found out [Runway] XXL was closed he had to change them back to [Runway] XXC. For a long time now I've witnessed stressful situations on the finals with regard to coordination. We have at least two controllers and three during busier times. Often we'll have a medical emergency or someone that requires priority. During visual conditions it is not too difficult to find room to fit them in the flow. Instrument conditions are entirely different and to aid in the coordination between three controllers and possible trainees is an absolute must. Many controllers at this facility have low time without experiencing the complete myriad of off the wall occurrences that can happen very quickly. Pair that with inexperienced supervisors who understandably want to let controllers do their job; but need to know when to take the helm. Too often one Arrival Controller isn't sure what the other one is doing with the emergency and the operation becomes inefficient or worse; dangerous. I would like to see supervisors/CIC's help out/coordinate more when these situations occur.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

486,486,486,486,10377,At the time of the incident I was being trained on the Local position. A Jetstream 41; requested to execute S-turns to loose altitude and land Runway 24. A Dash 8-300; was holding short of Runway 24 with a release time to ZZZ. Jetstream 41 was on a 3 mile final and had to loose a lot of altitude to land. With the distance between Jetstream 41 and the runway; taking into account the altitude of the aircraft; I believed it would delay Dash 8-300 passed the release time. Taking that into account I told Jetstream 41 to enter a right downwind for Runway 34 so I could depart Dash 8-300. At this time I issued traffic and cleared Dash 8-300 for take off. A PA-28 was on a 6-5 mile final Runway 34 and my plan was to sequence the Jetstream 41 behind the PA-28. I failed to coordinate with RADAR about Jetstream 41 changing runways and my Instructor stepped in to coordinate. With Jetstream 41 flying a standard pattern I believed there to be sufficient time to exchange traffic between Jetstream 41 and the PA-28. When I saw Jetstream 41 turning base early; about 0.5 miles; I quickly turned my attention to Dash 8-300 and in turn cancelled the take off clearance and told to hold position. I called traffic to PA-28 advising him of the Jetstream 41 in right base for Runway 34. The pilot reported it insight. Jetstream 41 landed; Dash 8-300 taxied off the runway; and PA-28 landed shortly after. Paint a better picture for all the aircraft involved; letting them know what is going. If I had told Jetstream 41 to enter right downwind for Runway 34 advising him that he is number two and exchanging traffic with Jetstream 41 and PA-28 it would have worked out a lot better allowing Dash 8-300 to depart without any trouble.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

489,489,489,489,3079,Per our local SOP; I forwarded a departure strip for IFR departure off Runway 13; within two minutes I forwarded a VFR departure strip for Aircraft Y (amphibian aircraft) and another IFR jet departure strip. The local SOP is not clear on headings for VFR departures; except for not being in the arrival corridor.  Aircraft Y was requesting a 125 heading and departing an intersection ahead of and Air Carrier X (who according to SOP would be runway heading.) I launched Aircraft Y on a 100 heading knowing that would allow me separation with the faster jet departing behind him. After observing the turn on Aircraft Y; I launched the Air Carrier X runway heading. I switched Aircraft Y to departure; and moments later switched the Air Carrier X to departure.  As I was giving a relief briefing; I noticed that Aircraft Y appeared to be turning on course (125 heading) which would cause the faster jet to climb through him to get above him.  I mentioned it to the relieving Controller and he said that obviously they turned him.  The local SOP for RADAR East states that 'the TRACON shall not cross or turn back into the ATIS departure corridor without prior coordination' which was not done.  As I had sent three departure strips to RADAR within approximately two minutes; I thought it would be obvious to RADAR to not turn Aircraft Y on course; as there would be two jet departures rolling shortly; and they are required to be runway heading. When my post brief time was complete; I stopped by the TRACON to [speak with] the radar trainee. The CIC2 asked what I was referring to I did not say anything because of the large number of trainees in his vicinity. The OJTI (on the opposite side of room than CIC2 ) asked what he missed and I told him that the amphibian was turned back into the departure pie without coordination.

494,494,494,494,5545,I was working Departure RADAR One at the time of the incident. I had been busy for some time with several departures; re-runs at NGU; and VFR pop-ups in my sector; not abnormal for the day and time. Traffic was beginning to slow. I took a RADAR handoff on a C177; from South Feeder inbound to ORF VFR. The scratch pad data indicated the aircraft was requesting Runway 14; since the wind was out of the southeast. I allowed the aircraft to continue toward the airport on its own navigation. As the aircraft neared the airport; I released several departures off Runway 23. When the C177 was approximately 5 miles from the field; I issued a turn to the east-northeast to keep the aircraft off the departure corridor. My intent was to put the aircraft east of the field for a left downwind entry to Runway 14. As I issued the turn; a B737 became airborne off Runway 23 climbing to 4;000 FT on runway heading. The C177 was directly on the departure corridor at 2;500 FT; now 3 miles in front of the B737; questioning my direction to turn; and still heading directly at the airport. I turned the C177 further to the east.  The B737 checked on frequency approximately 1 mile off the departure end. I issued the B737 a turn to a heading of 300 degrees for traffic. I could hear the TCAS advising of traffic as the pilot responded. I then made traffic calls for both aircraft. The C177 reported the B737 in sight and I issued him a descent at the pilot's discretion. After the traffic call to the B737; he reported he was responding to a resolution advisory. I acknowledged this and advised the B737 pilot that traffic was now behind him and issued a climb to 7;000 FT. As the aircraft passed each other; they were approximately a half mile apart. The B737 aircraft was subsequently turned on course and switched to the South Feeder Controller. The C177 was vectored to a point northeast of ORF; told to enter a left downwind for Runway 14; and switched to the Tower. Neither pilot issued a complaint on frequency. As soon as I was relieved; I advised the Front Line Manager of what transpired reference the B737 resolution advisory. I later advised the same FLM of my intentions to file this report and requested that I be permitted to see and hear both RADAR and audio recordings. Recommendation; don't depend on VFR GA pilots to respond to instructions in a timely manner if separation must be accomplished.

I file a similar report about a week ago about a Controller in the LaGuardia Tower. This time a similar thing happened with Newark Tower. I had departed and was heading directly towards Newark. After a while [departure airport] hands me over; and I make my initial call with Newark Tower. He asked for my intentions; and I told him that I wanted to fly direct to Newark; then to the Statue; then northbound over the Hudson. He gave me instructions to overfly the Newark airport. When I was about to hit class B airspace; I told him that I still don't have a Class B clearance; and he replied that; yes; I would; he gave me instructions how to fly over the airport. But; VFR traffic needs a clearance to enter class B airspace (unlike IFR).I criticize the following:- A very arrogant attitude towards VFR aircraft in the NY airspace area.

During the base turn we could see the approach end of the runway; but just barely.  During the turn to final; we decided to change to the ILS and expressed our desire to KTN radio.  They cleared us for it; and we engaged the approach mode of the autopilot.  We had briefed it during the decent as well just in case.  I put it into the FMC and we continued to the DH.  We could see the approach lights but not the runway; so we executed a missed.  Realizing we were on a different misssed approach in direction of hold; we made sure we told ANC ATC when we contacted them that we were on the missed approach from the ILS; not the RNAV.  Just before entering the hold; ANC ATC informed us of an altitude limit that they had that prevented them from giving us a late clearance for the ILS; but we thought KTN radios approval of the approach was good enough.  The ANC controller said it was pretty much for information only; but providing this report may help other crews in the future. Cause; misunderstanding of who can clear us for approaches.  We thought KTN radio could change us from the RNAV to the ILS.

499,499,499,499,7424,On approach into [Runway] [27C] in Chicago it was by all accounts a normal day. A storm had passed about 2 hours prior giving way to the benign conditions usually experienced after the passing of a storm. The wind was hardly noticeable I had nearly no crosswind correction in on the approach. As we approached the final approach fix Tower cleared a 777 to cross our landing runway. We continued; the aircraft was fully across the runway by the time we reached 1;000 feet AGL and parked on Taxiway TT. I assume he was waiting for a clearance from Ground to continue further. We continued on the approach and right as I was bringing the thrust levers back to idle a sudden jolt of firm left aileron and right rudder were needed to continue a safe ground track and land the aircraft. I am not sure exactly what bank angle was achieved but the proximity to the ground made it seem like quite a lot. My guess is around 10-12 degrees of bank at 10 feet off the ground. Some comments from passengers sounding the alarm that things where not correct when they got off the airplane make me think things where perhaps worse than I know due to the speed at which this all happened. The incident all happened approximately 10 ft AGL. Due to the suddenness and nature of the incident the best course of action was to land the aircraft. I had plenty of runway available to safely execute a full stop landing. Had the event happened at say 50 or 100 feet; a go-around would have certainly been necessary. The landing overall was completed without further incident. We taxied to gate; deplaned. And other than a few comments from Flight Attendants and passengers it was a normal operation. The cause of this sudden change and necessity for rudder and aileron was due to the 777 parked on Taxiway TT attempting to taxi right as I was landing. He was headed out for takeoff so I assume he was all loaded up and needed a lot of thrust to get moving. This is what caused such a dramatic necessity for correction very close to the ground. I hope out of this pilots and Controllers are made aware of the possibility of incidents like this in the future if we're not operationally prepared in some way. The cause of the event was the new taxi procedures and runway configuration due to the addition of 27C in Chicago. When cargo carriers taxi on TT they're putting anyone landing at risk of jet blast. At least a note could be added to our company pages alerting pilots about the possibility of this happening. But maybe even a change in how Chicago does taxi operations.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
500,500,500,500,4880,The crew was flying into BHM from the east. A cold front had just passed and was producing some light to moderate rain. The crew was flying in a CE501 which was on loan to them through a lease agreement. The crew was legal and current to be flying in this aircraft. However; it is not the aircraft that they fly on a daily basis.  Approach control gave vectors onto final to intercept the LOC of the ILS Runway 24 approach. The aircraft was approaching the LOC from the east. Approach control gave a final vector and told the crew to maintain 3000 feet until established and cleared them for the ILS Runway 24 approach. PIC believes they intercepted the LOC in proximity to SPATT intersection. Neither crewmember remembers whether the controller gave a distance referenced to any of the fixes along the LOC when cleared for the ILS Runway 24 approach. After about a minute of intersecting the LOC; the PIC decided to descend to GS intercept attitude of 2200 feet. Soon after descending; the controller issued a low altitude alert. The aircraft was between layers and had some visual contact with the ground; based on this the crew was not alarmed and verbally acknowledge the controller. Just prior to intercepting the GS at 2200 feet; the controller asked the crew for their altitude and the SIC responded with 2200 feet. The controller responded back with 'because the low altitude alert goes off below minimum vectoring altitude of 2600 feet'. The aircraft intercepted the GS and landed uneventful.The crew discussed the approach after the flight. The crew is uncertain what caused the low altitude alert; but theorized two possibilities. The PIC could have descended below the stepdown altitude of 2700 feet prior to reaching HUKEV stepdown fix. Another possibility could be a descent rate towards GS intercept altitude that triggered the alert.The aircraft flown was a CE501 on loan; instead of the crew's daily aircraft of CE525A and CE560. The FMS used as long range navigation was a Garmin 400; which the PIC is moderately proficient with. Since the crew was vectored onto final; the SIC programed the Garmin 400 using the Vectors to Final feature to load the ILS Runway 24 approach for situational awareness. One consideration of 'Vectors to Final' feature is that it removes from view any fixes prior to the FAF. In this instance; it removed from view stepdown fixes SPATT and HUKEV prior to FAF LOWGA. Had the stepdown fixes been in view; the crew might have remembered to consider the stepdown altitude at HUKEV.Also; the autopilot is a bit quirky especially regarding climbs and descents. Therefore; it was suggested to the PIC to fly autopilot in pitch mode. Autopilot responds smoother; but requires more attention to descend at a constant VS. With the high workload of an approach especially considering the weather in the vicinity; the PIC may have allowed the descent rate to fluctuate more than intended. This may have triggered the low altitude alert.Contributing factors:Proficiency with aircraft especially avionics and autopilot. Weather distractions.Corrective actions:Thoroughly brief approaches to include step down fixes and altitudes prior to FAF or FAP; even if they aren't anticipated to be used. Always load approaches into FMS to include step down fixes and altitudes prior to FAF or FAP to aid in situation awareness.

506,506,506,506,1570,Low time First Officer (1st flight after IOE) was flying visual. We were cleared for a visual approach. It was little high and fast so I suggested to him to slow down and start to configure. As he was extending the flight spoilers; Inboard Spoilerons; Outboard Spoilers Caution Message came on. I ran the QRH; stowed the flight spoilers according to the QRH procedure. At FAF; gear was extended; flaps were extended to 30. At this time; we encountered gust wind to cause aircraft nose to be pushed down which caused an unstabilized approach. It was too fast. I told First Officer (FO) to Go-Around but he insisted that he can land.  I told him 'my airplane' took over the control and Missed approached. As I was going around; I could not get First Officer to do anything. He was frozen. I had to configure the airplane for Go-Around. By the time I engaged the auto pilot and asked for HDG for a vector to come around; I was at 4;000 instead of 3;000 missed approach altitude. I reported to tower that we missed approach with current altitude. Then they assigned us 4;000 instead of 3;000. They cleared us to land via traffic pattern. We configured and landed safely.I should have executed the Go-Around procedure earlier. Go-Around and run the QRH and fix the problem in order to have a stablized approach.

508,508,508,508,8175,As we were beginning the approach for Runway 9R into PHL; just outside the final approach fix (KELEE) we encountered severe turbulence causing a momentary loss of aircraft control. We initially lost about 400 feet of altitude then an immediate reversal of the descent to about 2000 FT per minute climb to about 3;500 FT MSL before regaining control over the altitude. We also received roll deviations which were corrected. Upon the initial encounter of the turbulence; I called for a go-around and proceeded to advise ATC of the severe turbulence and advised we were not able to maintain our assigned altitude of 3;000 ft. The First Officer maintained wings and pitch level as best he could and added power as I brought the condition levers up. We received a vector to exit the approach corridor and proceeded south where we continued to receive moderate turbulence. We reconfigured the aircraft for normal flight and advised ATC we would need to divert.  Heavy rain showers in the area created moderate turbulence all around PHL. ATC advised the approach corridor looked acceptable on the radar so we accepted the approach clearance. We also did not detect any signs that severe turbulence may occur on the aircraft radar. We proceeded with a go-around and exited the area of severe turbulence and diverted. A maintenance write up was made because of the severe turbulence encounter. I believe there is a stigma about calling turbulence severe. If the aircraft in front of us had advised ATC that the turbulence was in fact severe; we would have never proceeded with the approach. After landing; the pilots of that aircraft in front of us had also diverted and admitted they should have reported the encounter as severe. Pilots should be reminded that it not only affects them when they label turbulence severe; but also keeps other aircraft from going through that same area.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
509,509,509,509,1943,Aircraft Y was handed off to me from the low sector climbing to FL230. I climbed Aircraft Y to his requested altitude of FL360. I left him on his filed route. I initiated the handoff and subsequently transferred radio communications after receipt of the handoff. I accepted the handoff on Aircraft X around the same time. Aircraft X checked in at FL370 deviating right of course. I believe I issued the weather in the vicinity of ZZZ.

After the aircraft passed each other; Aircraft X returned to his normal course and continued to deviate. The pilot of Aircraft X queried me as to what had happened. I told him a CRJ900 (no numbers given) had exceeded his assigned altitude. The pilot then asked me for Aircraft Y numbers. I told him I couldn't give that over the radio. He asked for and was provided a phone number to call the facility. I don't [know] why it happened. Aircraft Y read back his altitude assignment of FL360.

ATC was overwhelmed and could not give us requested higher altitude and due to high traffic in the area we did not initiate a further deviation right of course until we could ask ATC. Our radar was operating and being manipulated by the Captain showing no cells along our route of flight. We did not realize our radar had failed (no cockpit indications) and suddenly we were in a extreme thunderstorm cell. Our altitude deviated considerably 1;500 feet up and 700 feet down from FL350. We encountered light hail extreme precipitation and severe turbulence. Upon exiting the cell we immediately flew towards clear air and made the decision to divert to ZZZ.

511,511,511,511,1053,I was the non-flying pilot on Flight X. As we were arriving in the Phoenix terminal area from the northeast; we were cleared direct OBASE at 7;000 feet and given left or right deviation for weather. We crossed OBASE and were given a base turn for Runway 7R and instructions to descend to 5;000 feet. At this point we were 6+ miles north from intercepting the localizer. Maybe 90 seconds later; the Controller cleared us to 4;000 feet and asked if we had the field in sight. I expressed concern to my Captain that we were not going to be able to make it (meaning we would not be stable at 1;000 feet AFE because we were high and fast). My Captain gave me the thumbs up and I told the controller we had the airport in sight. The controller told us to intercept the localizer for Runway 7R and then cleared us for the visual. At this stage of the flight the aircraft was in full automation mode. The localizer was armed and had been identified. Right before we were intercepting the localizer; I looked down at my HSI and saw an aircraft within our 5-mile ring. As I was turning my head to look out my right window; I hear other traffic express concern to the Controller that they were too close to us. I then look back towards the runway and notice that we had flown through the localizer. I informed Captain and he immediately started to make the corrections. At this point I felt even more uncomfortable with our situation; so I called for the go-around. Captain immediately initiated the go-around. At some point either before I looked out the window for traffic or during the go-around; the autopilot was disconnected. Captain made the appropriate go-around calls and I made mine. I noticed that the autopilot was disconnected and I asked him if he wanted the autopilot; but he declined. Since we were above 1;000 feet AFE; I selected clean maneuver speed. As the plane started to increase in speed we cleaned up the flaps and again; I asked him if he wanted the autopilot and he declined. While all of this was happening; I tried to inform PHX ATC that we were going around. On my third call attempt; PHX ATC responded that we were to fly runway heading and level at 5;000 feet. During our level off the aircraft flew through 5;000 feet to 5;350 feet. I was making the appropriate calls. During the recovery we descended to 4;800 feet. Again; I called out our altitude and he corrected to 5;000 feet. I again asked Captain if he wanted the autopilot and he accepted. We were vectored around for a second approach and landed.I believe fatigue was a contributing factor in the sloppy approach and missed approached for both the Captain and myself. I regret allowing us to accept the base turn and the approach. We were high and fast on our base turn and I should have insisted on a vector to lose altitude and to slow the plane down. I never anticipated that there would be traffic; autopilot disconnected and a sloppy altitude capture. I'm upset that I gave the Captain the option to accept. My real out option was on the downwind. I have also noticed with pilots that have flown a lot in Europe that they want to apply a constant rate of descent to flying in the states. While I know this is a preferred method of flying; it simply doesn't apply for all airports in the United States. I usually warn them that certain airports like to slam us in and Phoenix is one of them. I'm not sure if I warned Captain or not; but will make it part of my brief in the future. As a crew member; I truly believe that I'm an outspoken pilot. I regret accepting the base turn and approach; it will not happen in the future. I plan on filing a fatigue event report and a hotel event report. The environment system in my room broke and it was loud and I was unable to fall back to sleep. I tried to go back to sleep but was unable.

513,513,513,513,6642,There appears to be inconsistency in controller acknowledgement of whether a pilot accepts a visual approach to an airport while on an IFR flight plan.I flew a long cross-country to Wisconsin. The trip was completed in three legs; all filed as IFR flight plans. This trip was fairly consistent with my making frequent long cross-country trips and all but the middle leg landing airport was a route that I have flown numerous times. The inconsistency reported here has been experienced on other occasions but not previously with the impact of a minor altitude deviation on the last leg at KMSN.The third leg of this trip was completed to KMSN. It was filed IFR direct at 6;000 feet and was completed as such accept some ATC vectors for traffic; parachute jumpers and weather. After Chicago Center turned me over to Rockford Approach; nearing the Wisconsin border they warned me of weather.  I acknowledged seeing a buildup that appears to be exceeding 20;000 feet in height and took ATC's offer for a deviation to the right (or east of route) of 10 degrees. Around the Wisconsin line Rockford Approach handed me off to Madison Approach. At that time I acknowledged receipt of ATIS information (that indicated runway 18 and 21 were active and lighting east of the field); requested immediate approval to step down in altitude; and told Madison Approach that the prior controller had approved a deviation of 10 degrees to the right of course.  Madison approach acknowledge with approval to step down in altitude to 4;000 feet; to expect runway 21. I confirmed runway 21 was acceptable and it was very logical with my course deviation east of the airport allowing me to line up with the approach.  There was a thunderstorm west of the airport; the cloud bases along the route of flight Madison approach was giving me resulted in me popping in and out if IMC conditions. The controller was handling another flight who was at 5;000 feet and was requesting numerous deviations due to weather; and the controller was giving him those deviations including one in which he referenced as acceptable under some sort of Milwaukee agreement.  During this routing of that other traffic; Madison approach was routinely giving me additional course adjustments vectoring me further away from the airport to the east. This was happening during a time period when the sun was going lower in the sky to the west and as I would turn into the airport I was effectively blind via a combination of sun angle; sporadic IMC conditions; and lightening both west of the airport in the obvious thunderstorm plus reported in ATIS as also east of the airport where the controller had routed me.  Eventually the controller turned me on vectors toward the airport for an approach to runway 22. This is where confusion arose in that I was on an IFR flight plan in IMC conditions (sporadic from the clouds but effectively continuously from the light) and I was not communicated as being on an instrument approach vector to runway 22 or a visual approach. However; eventually and repeatedly the controller ask me to confirm that I had the airport in site; implying but not confirming his expectation I was on a visual approach. I responded to each inquiry that I did NOT have the airport in sight. However; his request to confirm that resulted in me looking more aggressively out the window seeking the now implied visual to a Class C airport and the assumption I was no longer on my filed IFR flight plan as far as making an approach to runway 21. In the process of looking out and seeking to obtain visibility through the IMC conditions noted earlier I descended 200 feet below the last IFR altitude assignment the controller had given me; and he began aggressively telling me to return to it which I did immediately. He subsequently vectored me to an ILS approach to the runway; likely what he should have done initially with an aircraft on an IFR flight plan in IMC conditions.The procedural improvement opportunity fromthis experience at KMSN is that it would seem to make a lot of sense to have standard practice for a controller; confirming with a pilot the acceptance of a visual rather than instrument approach. It seemed reasonable with the routing vectors being given to both another aircraft and my aircraft that the planes were likely facing IMC conditions to some extent. It might be all fine and dandy that the airfield itself is reporting VFR conditions but that does NOT mean that approaching aircraft face those identical conditions; especially when the ATIS is reporting lightening to the east and obvious ATC vectoring for an active thunderstorm to the west would suggest to a reasonable person that conditions surrounding the airport were less than those on the airfield. Further; even if it were merely setting sun blinding the view out the cockpit to the field; it should be the pilot's option on an IFR flight plan to either keep an instrument approach or clearly confirm acceptance of a visual approach. And if a visual is provided; that the course and altitude to align to the runway is left in the pilot's hands to adjust to visible conditions as they seek visual confirmation of the active runway they have been assigned.  Controllers should offer but not assume acceptance of a visual approach from a pilot on an IFR flight plan; active confirmation of acceptance by the pilot should be required. Then confusion over authority to descend and maneuver for runway alignment would not be an issue with this clarity.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I; because of experience; added in a buffer to the time of several minutes as is my practice anyway; but if I had not done that this situation might not have been good at all.We should check the software in aircraft X to see if it is compatible with ATOP complex clearances and insure that this does not happen again.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

517,517,517,517,2389,On a typical; hot; Texas day I was flying a relatively light payload of cargo with building thunderstorms near Dallas and Houston. Our original flight plan was scheduled to make a fuel stop in Houston Hobby; then continue to destination. Upon looking at the current radar summary and satellite; the Captain and I decided to change our flight plan to Shreveport as the cells appeared to be moving in separate directions. Houston appeared to be in the path of the largest part of the storm. I had an XM weather display as well as the on-board WX radar to monitor the storms as we approached. The movement of the storms changed as they were growing rapidly; and the gap between them was getting smaller. About 50 miles to the south of the storms Houston Center advised that the gap was closed and aircraft had not penetrated the line for almost an hour. After discussing with the Captain; the on-board radar still showed almost a 15 mile gap in the cells with heavy precipitation. The tops in all the adjacent areas were reported 24;000 FT and lower. We were cruising at 17;000 FT and requested a block altitude of 16;000 to 18;000 FT in case of turbulence. Houston Center handed us off to Ft. Worth Center; who subsequently climbed us to FL190; deleting our block altitude clearance. We were told that the area was clear and we were given 'Deviations as necessary for Weather'. I slowed the plane to our turbulence penetration speed before entering the area between the cells 'painted' on the radar. The flight conditions included some light and moderate precipitation; trace rime ice; and light to moderate chop. The Captain issued a PIREP to the Controller as light chop; however; for just a moment or two we were caught in a moderate down draft and lost about 400 feet of altitude. We were close to the company limit on our Turbine Temps; and I elected that it was not necessary to add power. This resulted in slightly more time spent in our altitude deviation. Fort Worth acknowledged our deviation and advised us to return to FL190 when able. I returned to FL190 as soon as the aircraft was able; and within 15 more minutes we were out of IMC and descending for Shreveport. We continued the rest of the way to destination without further incident and delivered out freight.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
518,518,518,518,2372,Descending into ILM. Expecting a Visual approach to 24. We briefed the visual approach backed up by the ILS. Enroute; ATC kept us high and we required a steep descent to the airport. ATC recognized the need for an additional vector to give us more time to descend and turned us south. ATC instructed us to heading 280 and 1600 feet. This vector brought us inside the final approach fix SUMLY. This faced us into the sun and the haze made it harder to find the airport. They asked us if we had the airport and at the time we did not. As we approached the final; I started turning final and descending. ATC issued a low altitude alert and asked if we had the airport in sight. We reported that we did and he commented that we were assigned 1600 and hadn't been cleared for the visual approach. He issued the clearance for the visual and told us to contact tower.ATC communicated the altitude deviation to us. I was preoccupied with the descent into ILM and concerned about being high on final. I was also distracted by the poor vectors inside the FAF and hazy conditions. When ATC gave us the low altitude alert; I immediately added power and started climbing to 1600 feet; until he issued the clearance for the visual approach. This put us in a position high and fast for the approach. At 1000 feet I called not stable; go around and we started the go around procedure. We went around the pattern and the second landing was uneventful.In the future I will ask for better vectors and use the ILS unless we receive a visual clearance further from the airport that allows for proper planning of the approach.

520,520,520,520,427,Pilot was flying ZZZ-VOR-ZZZ1 on an IFR flight plan.  Pilot was flying with Sentry and XM radar weather. In communication with ZZZ Center; pilot was communicating heavy rain storm cells and asking for vectors to avoid the same. ZZZ Center authorized pilot to change course based on visual avoidance of clouds and based on XM weather. On heading of 269 south of VOR pilot was transiting through a line of light precipitation. Based on ATC guidance or XM weather no 'red' cells were observed on the radar. Pilot encountered significant hail and rain at that altitude and was having difficult holding altitude and advised ZZZ Center altitude errors and asked for a block hold. Upon trying to climb/vector to avoid thunderstorms pilot encountered a severe microburst that changed the heading of the plane from 269 to 090 in less than 15 seconds and pilot immediately reported the deviation and asked center for urgent assistance. Center authorized block altitude of 5;000-10;000 ft. and vectored the pilot back east away from the thunderstorms. Pilot flew back towards ZZZ and the transitioned north based on vectors from ZZZ. Pilot experienced loss in altitude and heading upon transitioning through the outer edge of the heavy precipitation cell.Pilot was concerned that XM radar data was outdated (>10 mins old) and was constantly inquiring about vectors from ATC. Sentry data was sporadic and difficult to load. Lack of quality data resulted in flight into significant thunderstorms resulting in change of heading and altitude.

521,521,521,521,7024,The flight to our filed destination was standard with the First Officer flying the leg. We had already flown several flights together both on this sequence and on previous sequences in the past. I consider the First Officer a highly skilled and competent pilot with a wide breadth of experience in both civil and military aviation. The routing to our destination was standard as per dispatch. The routing terminates at the airport; so it is expected that Approach Control will vector you to the approach starting at or above 10;000 MSL. As we descended approaching 10;000 MSL we were given vectors to the East side of the airport for a visual approach to Runway 19 on the west side of the airport. The aircraft was in selected Speed Mode and open descent thus allowing the crew to enter a visual pattern. Approach Control early on asked if we had the field in site.  Knowing that several months prior the news had continually reported a story of a freight aircraft landing at the wrong airport while attempting a visual approach into this airport; the First Officer and myself were focused on ensuring that we positively identified the nearby airport vs. our destination since we would be approaching from the east. This 'threat' as introduced by ATC asking for a visual ID of the airfield subsequently resulted in an 'error' on not activating the approach mode passing through 10;000 MSL as per A319 procedures. We entered downwind and immediately became concerned with the current wind conditions on the field.  Though within ops limits for the A319; we discussed that landing this aircraft in gusty conditions introduces some potential issues with the auto thrust system and the 'ground speed mini' system that is designed to maintain a constant ground speed during the approach.  At approximately 3;000 MSL; we turned to a left base with the field positively identified. The aircraft was in selected speed mode; the flaps were at 1 and the First Officer was hand flying the aircraft using flight director guidance; manual stick and autothrust. The FMGC was set up with the ILS approach and the 'green line?' extended off the FAF. The aircraft was being steered via heading select mode. At 3;000 MSL and turning left to final approach both pilot immediately noted the aircraft engines spooling up and the aircraft beginning to accelerate toward 200 KIAS. I immediately called 'watch your speed' and simultaneously looked at the speed select window. I noted the speed had reverted to 'managed' mode so I immediately pulled the speed select knob and spun the speed back to below 150 KIAS. As I spun the speed select knob I noted the airspeed indicator was just at or slightly below the barber pole but the aircraft and the airspeed trend arrow bouncing erratically due to the wind gust of up to 30 knots. Simultaneously First Officer pitched the aircraft up in an attempt to prevent over speeding the flaps. This minor altitude deviation resulted in the aircraft no longer being in a position to land; and thus we executed a right 270 to position the aircraft for a normal landing. The First Officer and [I] reviewed the incident during our layover and continued to use our available publications to ascertain as to why there was an inadvertent activation of the approach mode. Notes concerning this issue can be found in Operation Manual; though the Manual fails to explain why the approach mode will inadvertently activate. I have concluded that the A319 will automatically activate the approach mode when below 7;200 MSL (Ops Man Vol II); but if not established on a published segment of the approach; within a yet to be determined radial distance of the IAF. The issue is that since the aircraft is not on the approach segment but below 10;000 MSL; the aircraft attempts to accelerate to the default managed speed of 250 KIAS. This aspect must be explored in more depth by the appropriate Company department and subject matter experts to be verified. The anomaly cited above mustbe researched; validated and then taught as part of both initially qualification but also as part of recurrent training.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
522,522,522,522,5068,Aircraft was first cleared to FL270; subsequently the clearance descend via the GIBBZ2 was given and read back by the Captain. Both Pilot Flying and Pilot Monitoring did not understand that meant they could descend below FL270 via the arrival. Additionally it was briefed the GIBBZ Arrival is quite steep and drag may be needed; I queried the first observer if he agreed we were cellar via the arrival; he replied I was not paying attention. He then queried the Pilot Monitoring who said he thought it was FL270. I explained to him the decent via clearance at which point ATC was queried. They advised we were to comply with the altitude requirements on the arrival. They then issued a new altitude clearance and a heading. By the time I was able to clearly communicate to the crew we had already missed the FL250 crossing restriction at JIMVE. A contributing factor to this was the lack of intercom and boom mic for the second observer on the aircraft as I had to stand up to talk to the Pilot Monitoring clearly; additionally there is no port page annotation about the descend via clearance or the known steep arrival IAD combined with typically high tailwinds on this arrival.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
523,523,523,523,5831,I was working Tustin radar; the arrival sector for SNA in the morning. The weather was IFR with strong gusty winds from the west. Aircraft X was on a downwind heading at 3000 ft. for the ILS approach to SNA. Shortly after issuing the base leg heading of 100 I observed the target take a hard turn due south and a rapid descent from 3000 to 1600 ft. in a 3000 ft. MVA. The turn was so sharp and the descent so rapid that I thought it was a bad return from the STARS (Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System) tracker. Instead of issuing low altitude alert instructions I asked the pilot to verify that they were level at 3000. The pilot reported back that they were climbing back up and the altitude read out went to XXX. Once the aircraft climbed back up I issued a heading of 090 for the ILS. After clearing Aircraft X for the ILS the aircraft again dove down and dramatically turned to a heading approximately 30 degrees west bound away from the approach and into another aircraft on the downwind at 3000. If the pilot had not already done this I would have also thought it was a STARS issue. The two aircraft lost separation. Approximate separation was 1.9 miles and 100 ft. I turned Aircraft X back towards the final and instructed the aircraft to maintain 3000 as the MVA in the area is 3000. I issued traffic but both aircraft were IMC. I then canceled the approach clearance for Aircraft X and climbed the aircraft to 4000. When Aircraft X reached 4000 he advised that he was canceling IFR and wanted to proceed VFR to RNM. This event has been reported to the highest level of management at SCT.The week prior to this incident I was working an aircraft into TOA. The aircraft was established on the GPS approach to TOA when the STARS tracker showed the aircraft jump 1/2 mile north of the final towards traffic. When the aircraft's target turned northbound toward traffic I asked the pilot if they had turned northbound. The pilot reported that they were still pointed at the airport. The aircraft's speed increased to 360 kts and then jumped 1/2 mile to the south of the final into a 2700 ft. MVA. This incident was reported as a STARS issue.The controllers at SCT have lost confidence in STARS. We do not know if the data we observe on the scope is accurate information. We hesitate to issue instructions as we wait to see if what we are seeing is a STARS issue or is an accurate representation of what is actually occurring. We hesitate to issue immediate instructions because if the data is wrong we risk creating other issues. If I would have issued a traffic alert to the aircraft landing TOA and issued instructions to climb and turn left immediately to avoid traffic I would have interrupted the pilot in a critical phase of flight; turning the aircraft into an MVA based on erroneous data provided by STARS. If both incidents I described occurred with CARTS (Common Automated Radar Terminal System) I would have known that what I was seeing was true and I would have issued instructions immediately. But instead; we have become so numb to the erroneous information from STARS that we hesitate and second guess. This hesitation and second guessing may cause fatalities as the instructions we give will be too late to save the situation.I recommend that SCT falls back to CARTS or fatalities may occur.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

525,525,525,525,3685,We were given multiple route changes from our filed VISTA TWO.JLI STAR. ATC didn't like our filed route and told us of some letter of agreement between our airline and ATC to do some other STAR when inbound from PHX. We advised Dispatch to let them know that the filed STAR wasn't something LA wanted. Shortly; as I was getting ATIS and gate info and trying to run the checklists; we were cleared to do the OLDEE ONE STAR to SEAVU. Once inbound ATC varied our speeds and altitudes and had us cross LAADY at 16;000 [vice at or below FL190 at 280 KTS]. Then told us to 'descend; via; the OLDEE 1 STAR; cleared the 24R ILS after SEAVU.' As we were double checking the fixes in the FMS reprogramming for the 24R ILS (we had in 25L) and I was doing the PA and interrupted checklist; I missed that the Captain started the descent earlier then WYVIL (I'm not sure if it was because we were lower then the descent profile to begin with--being at LAADY at 16;000 and; so; not on the 'programmed' VNAV PATH--or if the VNAV guidance 'fell out' of VNAV PATH. I do know the Captain had the correct info executed in the FMS and had pushed VNAV.) We were told to stop our descent somewhere around 15;000 FT when we were past LAADY and; perhaps; past WYVIL. We ended up at 14;500 FT between WYVIL and OLDEE! I then queried ATC if they wanted us to continue the descent to cross 14;000 at OLDEE? They then cleared us off the STAR and gave us direct to a fix on the ILS and gave us step down alt. ATC said we were not supposed to descend below 16;000 until past WYVIL; to which I didn't respond to because I wasn't sure if they were going to violate us or not. We had an inadvertent altitude deviation caused by too many changes in a high workload environment. I had not had much sleep the night before when Scheduling called early for a less than two hour show. We pushed a few hours later and I was not on top of all the ATC changes that they were throwing at us. I should have done ATIS; gate ACARS; PA and Checklists much sooner and been ready for many ATC changes in LAX as I've been here before and know they like to mess with us; but I was a bit slow that morning. Both the Captain and I double checked the FMS inputs and they were correct; but I didn't monitor the VNAV path as I should have because of trying to do too much at once. I believe ATC should not clear us to descend via a star unless they are going to keep us on it as published--especially when we are already off profile to begin with.

526,526,526,526,7199,I; the pilot in command; was on a cross country flight to Lee County Airport and was cleared by Indianapolis Center for the RNAV approach to Runway 25; Lee County Airport (0VG). Upon receiving clearance; having misread the approach plate; I descended to 5;400 FT MSL. From the northeasterly direction I was arriving the minimum safe altitude within 30 nautical miles of the initial approach fix HUXAM was 6;100 FT. I also switched to the CTAF frequency for Lee County airport after being cleared for the approach. I was contacted by a Beechcraft; who had been instructed by Center to tell me to return to Center frequency. I did so; and was instructed to return to the correct Minimum Safe Altitude by Indianapolis Center. I climbed back to the correct minimum safe altitude.

527,527,527,527,7887,On descent to landing at DEN; the F/O (First Officer) and I incorrectly set 30.37 instead of the field altimeter of 29.37 passing through FL180. While conducting the Approach Checklist; each of us checked the setting against each other; but neither checked the setting against the copy of ATIS; which was correct. The descent; with vectors for weather and to join the downwind; did not include a level off; which might have allowed ATC to catch our lower than cleared altitude. In visual conditions; on a vector for base leg and cleared to descend out of 9000 ft MSL to 7500 ft MSL; I started to think something was wrong; specifically; why are we cleared to an altitude that looks so close to the ground; so far from the field? The radio altimeter showed a descent through about 1200 ft AGL when I started verbalized my concerns with the F/O who was; correctly; on an inside scan. I called for a climb and 'helped' by adding power while the F/O caught up with our evolving understanding that something was wrong with the clearance. The lowest radio altimeter reading I saw was 800 ft AGL when more or less at the same time the altitude warning based on configuration activated; and Approach Control gave us a Low Altitude alert.

528,528,528,528,1321,Center handed us off to Approach. The Captain (pilot not flying) checked in and reported the airport in sight. Approach immediately cleared us for the visual approach. I moved the first fix on the ILS to the 'direct-to' position in the FMS and executed the change; then dialed 5;000 FT into the altitude preselect; as that is the 'at or above' altitude that coincides with the fix. I was demonstrating a flight idle descent technique that I prefer to the Captain and continued that descent toward the final approach course. At approximately 5;200 FT; the GPWS warning flasher illuminated and the aural alert 'TERRAIN; TERRAIN; PULL UP!' sounded. I immediately disengaged the autopilot; added power and began climbing. At the same time; the Approach Controller issued an altitude alert. Once clear of the conflict; I continued descent and landed uneventfully. I believe the following contributed to this event:We were at the end of a very long day; having already flown three legs before this leg. Both of us were quite tired and had discussed how fatiguing our schedule was. Neither of us had terrain display activated on our MFD; despite the dark night and being well aware of the terrain north of our destination airport; (we've both flown this route probably hundreds of times -- complacency?) Unless an arrival transition is selected; our aircraft's FMS begins the ILS at the first fix. This hides the higher minimum altitudes at the previous fixes that guarantee terrain separation. Also; our approach angle from slightly west of final compounded the terrain separation problem; as the ILS final skirts the east edge of the ridge line in the vicinity of high terrain. Since conditions were severe clear and I was flying a visual approach; I was not referencing the ILS approach plate; which might have reminded me of the higher minimum altitudes. Bottom line: we screwed up. We should have had terrain display turned on. We should have asked for vectors to final; given our level of fatigue and the fact that it was nighttime. Instead we were focused on getting to the hotel for some sleep; and took the shortest route direct to the runway. I should have been 100% focused on a safe arrival and postponed my idle descent demo for a daytime flight when we were both fresh. The GPWS worked as designed and the Controller was alert and proactive. One sobering note: Yesterday we flew an aircraft with the GPS system MELed. Several times that day we saw a 'Terrain Unavailable' message from the FMS (common with this aircraft type when position accuracy is degraded). Had we been flying that aircraft tonight; the outcome might have been very different.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
529,529,529,529,9733,This event took place on a flight to ORD. The Captain was the PF. We acknowledged building weather down final when cleared the approach to 9L and switched to tower. We intercepted the glideslope and; at around 2500 ft MSL; encountered a sudden tailwind. With AP (autopilot) engaged; the nose pitched down; throttles went to idle; and the jet was accelerating. The Captain recognized this as a potential microburst situation and called a go-around. FO called the go-around and tower told us to track the localizer and maintain 3000 ft MSL. We maintained airspeed; went flaps 15; and maintained 3000 ft. Tower then directed a left turn to 040; which was a turn into the weather. We delayed the turn and focused on flying the aircraft; though in the process tracked slightly right of course to remain clear of the weather. Tower again gave us the left turn to 040 and we headed that way. Tower then directed a climb to 4000 ft. Some confusion ensued with our automation during this process; though positive aircraft control was always maintained by the Captain. HDG SEL would not initially engage; we believe; because the approach was still armed. Our FDs also did not assist in our climb to 4000 ft because; as memory serves; our command for VS on the MCP did not take. The Captain hand flew the jet but was unable to level off at 4000 ft due to a significant updraft. Both crew members repeatedly acknowledged the impending and actual climb through the assigned altitude and FO reported a 'significant updraft' with ATC. We believe that; at most; the jet reached 5000 ft. ATC responded with a quick; respectful; and deferential 'okay;' understanding that we were aviating first. At this point we were indeed still dealing with the effects of the weather and focused on controlling the aircraft. We finished cleaning up the aircraft and requested a heading to our divert airport. Either due to yoke inputs while flying through the weather; or due to automation difficulties; the Captain's AP would not engage for some time. The Captain told ATC that we were low on fuel and were unwilling 'to fly through that thunderstorm again.' After receiving our heading to ZZZ we noticed the Captain's FMC was frozen. The FO's FMC was functional and we are not sure when the left FMC froze. Our divert to ZZZ was otherwise uneventful; as was our delayed but successful flight to ORD later that evening.We are certain a go-around was the right decision and are happy we kept the jet at a safe altitude above the ground. We could have performed a cleaner go-around but were focused on flying the aircraft around the weather and not exceeding any speed limitations. Our impression was that ATC understood that we were busy dealing with significant weather. Their 'okay' had a tone of deference and understanding; and we doubt they will mark this as a pilot deviation. In hindsight; we believe the best decision would have been to not accept the approach clearance and ask for a safe heading away from the weather. We did not have situational awareness on whether traffic behind us was cleared the ILS to 9L; but we hope not.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Captain overshot altitude by more than 450 FT. An immediate return to altitude was performed. We were subsequently given a climb to 3000 FT after a minute or two. We had to try three different approach frequencies before Tower found a good one for us to switch to. We returned for an uneventful visual approach and landing.

531,531,531,531,5414,I was enroute on an IFR flight plan at 12;000 feet. Center had cleared me direct [VOR]; then as filed.

Concerned about an engine failure in instrument conditions; I immediately reduced power and began to search for the nearest airport with an instrument approach using my GPS. Center then called; asking for my altitude. I explained the situation and requested information as to the nearest suitable airport. Center replied that ZZZ was nearby and gave me a heading; and a clearance to descend and maintain 7;000 feet; if possible. I turned toward the airport and continued my descent. As I descended; the aircraft emerged from the clouds and I saw the airport at 12 o'clock. At that point I cancelled IFR; continued the descent and landed without incident. The problem was that I did not remain on my cleared heading and altitude due to the fact that I prioritized maintaining whatever engine power I might have left for a precautionary landing.

532,532,532,532,7212,We were filed on the GRNPA 1 RNAV arrival but given a clearance direct to the KSINO intersection and clearance to descend to FL 220. We had expected and briefed the RNAV visual approach to runway 19R. When we were cleared direct to KSINO were were told to expect an ILS to 25L. We were switched over to approach control without hearing or acknowledging any further descent clearance. When we switched over to approach control we were approaching the LUXOR intersection and were still at FL220.On initial contact the controller seemed a little confused and ask us if were were landing at LAS. We told her that we were and asked her why she was asking. She told us because we were crossing the LUXOR intersection at FL 220 when normally LAX center would have given us clearance to cross the intersection at 12;000 feet. We replied that were were never given a descend via or any other lower altitude.We were given a last minute runway change and were task saturated trying to set up and brief a new approach at the last minute. As a result we did not noticed that we were never given a lower altitude by LAX Center before approaching the LUXOR intersection. A contributing factor was that the First Officer (FO) was new to the Airplane; had about 100 hrs total time in type; and had never flown into LAS before.As has been said time and again concerning the descend via arrivals....'.if they just leave you on the route and give you a descend via from cruise altitude to the bottom altitude without any changes then things generally go smooth'. Once they give you directs and a descend to an intermediate altitude or take you off the route; that's when problems happen.

534,534,534,534,534,The main issue was multiple similar sounding call signs. One aircraft took the others clearance. This took place on Sector 24 (altitude limits of FL360 and up) at Denver Center ZDV. There was a band of chop and turbulence on the western half of the sector in the higher altitudes. Most west bound aircraft would request to descend to the low Flight Level 300s to get out of the bumps. Some of the east bound aircraft would remain at altitude since they had already been dealing with the bad rides for a while. Air Carrier XXYX was west bound at FL400 and getting close to the area most aircraft started requesting a descent. Air Carrier XXXX at FL410; east bound; had just come over from Los Angles Center ZLA Sector 32. The confusion was in the two similar sounding call signs. The frequency and workload was high due to so many aircraft requesting altitude changes. Many altitude descents were being given too many aircraft. During this time; Air Carrier XXXX requested lower. Also; during this time; Air Carrier XXYX was descended to FL380 and told to expect lower clear of traffic. Air Carrier XXXX took Air Carrier XXYXs clearance and started to descend. Air Carrier XXYX said they did not want lower yet. It was then discovered that Air Carrier XXXX was the one descending. When questioned; Air Carrier XXXX stated they had requested FL310; and were descending to that altitude. Understanding that they took the other aircrafts clearance; I pointed out that the clearance was only to FL380. Air Carrier XXXX stated that they had not read back the clearance; and that they had just started descending. At this point it was determined that traffic was not a factor; and Air Carrier XXXX was assigned a descent to FL360 and to expect lower with the next sector. Though traffic was not an issue; it is questionable whether Air Carrier XXXX was clear of the ZLA Sector 32/ZDV Sector 24 boundary prior to starting the descent. As an additional note; before these two aircraft were out of the sector; Air Carrier XYYX entered the sector. There were now three company aircraft within the same sector with similar call signs:  XYYX; XXXX; and XXYX. Recommendation; both Controllers and Pilots need to be extremely aware when complexity is high. The Controller is trying to keep the sector running. The Pilots (in this situation) are uncomfortable due to the turbulence and just want to move. So everyone is just a bit rushed. Of course; the Controller needs to keep awareness up of who is saying what. However; it is also always important for an impatient pilot to make sure they are hearing something actually being said to them; as versus what they want. Also; I think at issue here is such similar call signs by the same company (Air Carrier XYYX; Air Carrier XXXX; Air Carrier XXYX). There were two similar ones at the time of this situation; and a third came into the sector while the other two were still there. I realize aircraft are crisscrossing all over the country at different times on different routes.

I looked over to my iPad chart for ROBUC2 and it is rather confusing for the arrival into the several runways. The lines for each waypoint after PROVI take you to different arrivals for the different runways. For example JOODY takes you to 4R; JAYNA takes you to 15R; and I thought KRANN takes you to runway 27 and ANSLY for runway 22L but I got those two last mixed up KRANN and ANSLY.

542,542,542,542,4888,Prior to leaving hotel; reviewed company memo on departures out of LAS. I thought I had a clear understanding of issues involved. During preflight; read NOTAMS and saw different verbiage than depicted on departure chart. Amended FMS to what I believed the NOTAM said and asked SIC who was the pilot flying to verify my understanding and changes to FMS. He did so and concurred. The departure was the SHEAD7 off of Runway 1L. Departed normally and discovered error when ATC notified us of non-compliance with altitude restrictions. The changes in the FMS resulted in the deviation. After reading the NOTAM; I erroneously translated the information as to how it would be depicted on the chart. Thinking the NOTAM had more current information led me to the wrong conclusion. It had some supplemental information but a correct reading would have shown me that the altitude restrictions still applied. After the event; TRACON was able to coordinate with arrival sector and no loss of separation occurred. We were given a phone number to call and did so after the flight. Talked with a specialist and the Operations Manager and they both said this type of deviation happens frequently. I am aware of my errors in this event and accept responsibility. I would suggest that only one altitude be depicted on chart for any given fix. Place engine out/minimum reception information on another section of the chart or perhaps another page entirely. Limit NOTAM information to the minimum necessary for safety. Once information is capable of being printed on charts; rescind the NOTAM. Currently; printing the NOTAMS for LAS results in more than three pages of information. I should have reviewed the company memo again in the cockpit.

543,543,543,543,3484,Level at filed cruise altitude of FL400 in constant light to intermittent moderate turbulence. There was a large storm system over South Florida; the Keys; and the eastern portions of the Gulf of Mexico. Miami Center requested we climb to FL410 for a smoother ride; we agreed as we were right in the tops and the CRZ page in the FMC indicated a max altitude of FL410. We accepted a climb to FL410. Now with Havana Center; we had a build up along our route just to the north that we estimated topped FL430-FL450. Westerly winds exceeding 100 KTS at altitude. We requested a southwesterly heading from Havana Center to keep a safe distance from this cell. Approximately 20-30 miles east of this cell (and directly downwind) we experienced very abrupt moderate chop. Immediately the speed trend vector decreased very rapidly into the min safe range/lower fishhook. As the stick shaker activated the Captain stated 'I have controls'. The airplane banked right approximately 30 degrees and back to the left approximately 20-30 degrees. I observed altitude deviation of up to +300 and -200 FT. As the now pilot not flying; I requested immediate descent to FL400 from Havana Center. Descent clearance was approved. We descended to FL400 with no further incident. The event occurred because we did not maintain an adequate buffet margin at altitude with the present weather conditions. When the Captain took control he added thrust and hand flew the airplane attempting to maintain assigned alt and heading. When operating in the weather conditions that we were; a greater margin of safely operable speed range is required. I.e. [we should have been at] a lower altitude.

544,544,544,544,10229,Speed and altitude deviation on the ANCHR2 arrival on the arrival phase into DEN the flight was task saturated due to atc. Atc had given us 3 different arrival procedures and multiple turns off course. While on a heading and abeam LIBIE we were given hold at LIBIE at FL230 and expedite down to 230. We were at about fl270.  We were about 4 miles from LIBIE and we needed to make a 90 degree turn to get there so we entered the hold manually and set up the fms once we were far enough away it would accept it. No problems there.  Later; after released from the hold we were about 3 from HIGUN and I reminded my fo about the speed restriction of 210 at HIGUN. he was still in manual speed mode from using it in the hold.  He then went full speed brakes to slow down and I don't think he was in fms speeds yet because the aircraft got slow.  He said he must have hit the toga button when he was going for the speed brakes.  The plane went into go around mode and started to climb. I shut the speed brakes and told him to watch his speed and altitude. I then took over the controls and got the speed and altitude back and set up the automation for him and gave him back the controls. I believe we got about 50 knots too fast and between 700 and 1700 feet high.  Soon after that we were on the localizer for 17r and the fms still had the arrival starting at ANCHR 3 times.  We entered icing conditions. I tried to clean up the flight plan in the fms and it wouldn't let me. I also needed to enter ice speeds and did so. meanwhile the fo (pilot flying) did not start the descent on the localizer so atc turned us off the loc and re sequenced us. I believe we were still about 15 miles out at that time. I believe the fo got very flustered after the hold instructions even though the hold went fine.  I think that led to an over reaction to the speed assignment at HIGUN.  I could have taken the controls sooner and maybe there would have been no deviation.  I was trying to talk him through the recovery but he didn't respond.   I don't really have a good solution.  I believe being comfortable with manual mode and not relying so much on the fms is important.

The bulletin says for RW7 departures you have to depart RNAV/VNAV off; turn at 4 DME and maintain V2+20. The diagram shows exceedance of the R113 radial on many RW7 departures and no other types of departures leaving MROC. The 10-7 page says the same thing if you are flying the POAS4 departure. (The bulletin says RW7 departures period). The flight plan had us filed direct RADON; with no SID assigned. ATC assigned us the COCOS5 RNAV; which is a straight out departure; over lower terrain; with an engine failure procedure to turn back to TIO between the first two waypoints. The COCOS5 requires a significant climb gradient; with a note specifically stating you must make the climb gradient. We estimated we could make the climb gradient based on distance and alt; required climb gradient table to at least above the MSA for the area. The departure has restrictions based on arrival traffic that go up to over FL230. We flew the departure and at about 15;000 feet were cleared to climb unrestricted. Although we had zero deviations from out clearance; I don't think we could have cleared the climb restrictions. We crossed the FL200 restriction at 19.3; and the FL230 restriction at about FL200; 270 KTS. Confusion results for the bulletin implying that the only way to leave MROC on RW7 is to follow the bulletin guidance (Do we have to tell ATC we cannot accept anything but the POAS4 departure?)

I was briefing the Handoff Controller with the sector information and traffic when I noticed the CRJ leaving 13;900 FT crossing in front of the departure. I turned the CRJ to 250 heading; climbed to 15;000 FT; and issued traffic. The departure had my arrival in sight and was instructed to maintain visual separation. The conflict alert never went off. The CRJ went down to 13;100 FT on a 250 heading to get more separation before climbing back up to 15;000 FT. The CRJ was never cleared to descend via the LEEHY 3 Arrival. I think when I re-cleared the CRJ direct PITTT they assumed they had a descent to 11;000 FT; which is the altitude they would descend to with restrictions if they were cleared to descend via the LEEHY 3 Arrival.When I re-clear an aircraft that was on a RNAV arrival direct a new fix on that arrival; [I should] restate an altitude no matter if it is the same altitude that was previously issued.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
550,550,550,550,5606,I was working Final radar when the PA46 checked in on course to PGD. The pilot requested the RNAV Runway 33 Approach at PGD. I coordinated with the Tower and they approved the approach. I gave the aircraft a 160 heading in order to comply with his request. The pilot followed my instructions and flew the 160 heading. The pilot then asked for lower; and I descended him to 2;500 from his original 3;000. A couple miles later he asked me for lower again. I advised that I was unable to descend him any lower because of the antennas [in the vicinity] and that was the [initial] altitude of the approach he was requesting. When the pilot got abeam the final approach fix; I cleared him to '...turn right direct PETSE; four miles from PETSE; cross PETSE at 2;500; cleared RNAV Runway 33 Approach'. The pilot read back; 'Turn direct PETSE; cleared approach'. I didn't see anything wrong with that because the altitude is published on the approach plate. After a couple of sweeps on the radar scope; the pilot descended from 2;500 to 1;500 MSL less than half a mile from the antennas at SERFS. When I noticed it; I told the pilot that he was supposed to cross PETSE at 2;500 and that was why I could not descend him any lower. His response was; 'OH'.

Over the central Sierra Nevada mountains the airspeed immediately jumped up to .84 mach and we hit a descending mountain wave exceeding 1;000 FPM.

Departed ZZZ weather was 500 overcast and 1 mile visibility. Takeoff and departure was uneventful other than Icing conditions enroute (all anti ice was on) at approximately 25 miles from ZZZZZ intersection Center inquired about my altitude stating I was 300 to 400 feet high with the correct altimeter setting; I reset the altimeter which corrected the problem; shortly after that the Autopilot disengaged causing the aircraft to yaw hard. Hand flying the aircraft I contacted Center about the Autopilot and request to return to ZZZ. After completing the turn towards ZZZ it became apparent that I was having a problem trimming the aircraft for level flight; which wanted to pitch downward even after adjusting the trim wheel which was stiff to turn. During this time period ATC notified me of low altitude and to take immediate action which I did; holding the aircraft in level flight. I tried engaging the autopilot which would nose over abruptly. With not being able to trim the aircraft properly I was having difficulty maintaining heading and altitude; while trying to program the GPS for the approach into ZZZ. I had to go missed due to low visibility I then diverted to ZZZ1. I continued to have difficulty holding altitude and programing the GPS while enroute to ZZZ1. Tried the autopilot again which still nosed the aircraft downward. Flying into IMC and icing conditions at night with not being proficient with the new avionics contributed to not being able to maintain altitude.

557,557,557,557,2441,The weather was relatively nice with occasional light turbulence. We did however have a strong tailwind. The wind component on our tail was slightly larger than 125 KTS. There was some discussion on the radio amongst other airliners as to potential difficulty in making descent restrictions; of course due to the high resultant ground speed due to the tailwinds. We were given a clearance to cross the intersection at FL290. The Captain was the flying pilot and entered 29;000 in the FCU altitude window. As we were on a published segment of the arrival; and navigating in a 'managed mode;' he pushed the altitude selector knob and we began our descent. It appeared to me that we had plenty of room to get down to FL290. I did the 'mental math' using the 3:1 descent ratio we traditionally utilize; and added a few miles to my number as a fudge factor to compensate for our increased ground speed. The flight management computer did in fact also indicate to us that we were currently below the profile; and therefore the aircraft would be limited to a descent rate of 1;000 FPM until it reached the proper idle descent point. At that time; because we were utilizing a 'managed mode of descent;' the aircraft would transition to an idle descent to reach the intersection at FL290. I left radio one to communicate with the flight attendants dealing with a minor cabin maintenance issue. I updated our arrival weather and gate information and made an announcement to the passengers. When I returned to radio one I noticed that the aircraft was in a 300 FPM descent and was getting increasingly higher on the profile; indicating that we would not make our descent restriction. At this time; the Captain disengaged all automation hand-flew the aircraft attempting to make our restriction at the intersection. At this was occurring; we were given a frequency change and as I checked in with Center. I told them that; while we were doing 'all we could do to get down; we were going to be high at the intersection.' The Center Controller simply acknowledged my transmission. There was no traffic issue; just another airliner crossing an intersection high. We crossed the intersection at 30;500 and made 29;000 very quickly. Nothing was said by ATC or by us further on this error. I am not in any way placing any of the blame on ATC for this missed restriction. We should have been more attentive to our aircraft's descent path. It does often bother me however that ATC does not take into account tailwind affect on time to descend. This is not the first time an A321 has had an issue making a descent restriction. I have heard from other pilots about the aircraft reverting to a 300 FPM descent when it gets 'confused.' I am not sure how we got from a 1;000 FPM managed descent to a 300 FPM vertical speed descent. I did not see the Captain select this descent rate; and he claims not to have done so.

558,558,558,558,3700,This was only the second time I have flown into DCA as a Captain and the second time I have flown the River Visual to 19. Since I had a fairly new First Officer; I decided I would be pilot flying for this leg. During cruise flight we briefed the FRDMM Arrival and the River Visual 19 and highlighted all the important information. This flight was delayed due to a ground stop to DCA. There was a line of weather between [departure airport] and DCA and it was affecting the East Coast. After about an hour on the ground; we were on our way to DCA.After BUCKO Washington Center gave us a 'descend via' clearance. Between HONNR and PLDGE; we requested deviations for weather. We were deviating right for weather direct PLDGE when able. As we were about to descend through FL250; Washington Center asked if we were direct PLDGE yet and we responded no. Center amended our altitude and said maintain FL250. I turned off the autopilot and leveled the aircraft at FL250. Soon he gave us FL220 and turned direct to PLDGE; but Center still wanted us meet the restriction at PLDGE between 17;000 and 15;000. We told Center we will unable to do that now because of the change in altitude assignment. Center was not happy. We would have had to descend at 5;000 FPM to comply with that restriction. I told Center we could give him 3;000 FPM. Center then said to descend and maintain 14;000. Washington Center transferred us to Potomac Approach who gave us descend via clearance again and stated we would be okay if we were high on the next few fixes. We didn't have any issue meeting the rest of the restrictions on the arrival.Somewhere along the way we either had a controller change or a frequency for approach change because the controller's voice was different. We began getting vectored for the River Approach and lower altitudes; but the controllers had not slowed us down. Approach turned us in early and cleared us for the River Visual 19 and began slowing us. So I began to hand fly the aircraft to slow and get configured. The controller gave us 170 knots and then shortly 150 knots. I decided to use the flight spoilers to help slow down and was focused on flying down the middle of the river to avoid the P56A and B restricted areas; maintaining a proper descent to the runway and maintaining proper airspeed. I was so focused on those things that after we were fully configured for landing and on glide path; I forget to stow the flight spoilers. My First Officer did not notice they were still out. The aircraft flight spoiler warning sounded and I immediately stowed the flight spoilers.I felt like I was having to work harder than I thought I should on the approach; but was so focused on the glide path and restricted areas; I had not noticed that I was adding more power than usual because I was hand flying; watching my glide path and vertical path; not my power setting. When we were lined up on final for the runway; I was on glide path; and airspeed and continued to landing. On landing the thrust reversers did not deploy. After discussing that with First Officer; I was told I didn't call for the landing check. I don't remember if I did or didn't; but I do remember that landing check was not run. Our landing data received didn't require thrust reversers; but I know normal procedures require the use of them. Since the thrust reversers were not used the brakes did warm a little more than usual to 7 and 8; but cooled down to normal limits before we departed.The threats were many and I thought we discussed them in cruise. We talked about the FRDMM Arrival and all the altitude and speed restrictions; the River Visual 19 and its associated threats and that this airport was new to both of us. We discussed the weather in route. Washington Center stopped our descent causing us to be high on the arrival which caused us to have to work harder to get back on the arrival. I should have asked for slower from Potomac approach earlier to be configured so not to have to use the flight spoilers to slow down. Having the flight spoilers out that low was an error and undesired aircraft state. Forgetting to call for and/or run the landing check could have had much worst consequences if we had not been fully configured or if the runway data required thrust reversers.I will take more time to brief the arrivals and especially the River Visual 19 or other approaches similar to that with more clarity and what is expected from both of us if we stray from procedures. I would also challenge my First Officers to be more assertive when it comes to checklists; especially if I am pilot flying and forget to call for a checklist. I believe the First officers should at least ask if I would like a checklist ran rather than not do it. I would also brief things like if I leave the flight spoilers out and my hand is not on the handle; ask if I am still using the flight spoilers.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

561,561,561,561,10260,We were flying to MSP at our filed altitude of 14;000 feet; we were instructed to descend via the MUSCL2 RNAV arrival. We plugged in a 3 degree glideslope and verified that if we maintained 3 degrees we would make all crossing restrictions and arrive at our HARD limit of 8;000 feet and 230 kts at CMMOE. We briefed that we would descend at the 3 degree slope. The first officer was pilot flying and began his descent via the arrival. ATC then informed us that we had VFR traffic unverified at our 12 o'clock position and that he wanted us to level off at 10;000 feet. We dialed in 10;000 feet and leveled off at 10;000 feet. After a short time ATC instructed us that the traffic was no longer a factor. I asked the controller if he would like us to resume to 'descend via the arrival' and he said yes. The first officer then dialed in 8;000 feet into the altitude selector and called for the approach checklist. I performed the approach check flow and verified completion with the checklist. It was at this point that I noticed the First Officer had initiated his descent to 8;000 feet prior to crossing WDBRY at 10;000 feet and 250 kts. I called out 'altitude and that we should be at 10;000 feet still'. The first officer kind of froze so I quick hit the ALT button on the mode control panel so the plane would level off. I'm not 100 percent sure but I believe I hit the ALT button at about 9;600-9;700 feet and the plane descended as low as 9;500 feet before slightly climbing back to 9;700 ft. At this point we were very close to WDBRY and did not have time to climb back up to 10;000 before crossing so we held level at 9;700 feet as we crossed. We then descended to cross CMMOE at 8;000 feet and 230 kts per the arrival. The rest of the flight was uneventful. After landing and parking at the gate we debriefed what happened; what the contributing factors were; and how to prevent the re-occurrence. I believe that the First officer fully intended to meet all crossing restrictions properly. He just focused on making sure he crossed CMMOE at 8;000 and 230 kts that he forgot that he had to cross WDBRY at 10;000 feet. Fortunately the position that the descent was initiated was just prior to the crossing fix so that the deviation was minor and corrected fairly quickly and didn't create any traffic conflicts.I think the contributing factors were 1. Low familiarity and comfort level in the aircraft slightly decreasing situational positional awareness. (First Officer has only been on the line a couple months).2. Low familiarity with descend via arrivals.3. Being taken off the descend via clearance due to traffic and then being told to resume got the pilot flying a little out of sequence. 4. Event occurred at a time that I (pilot monitoring) was performing an approach flow and checklist.5. during the debrief we discussed 'descend via' procedures and techniques and I feel that maybe the First Officer didn't have a completely solid understanding of techniques and procedures to help ensure and safeguard that all crossing restrictions are met accurately. I feel like 'descend via the arrival' procedures have been an area that some pilots are struggling with and it is common to see a vast array of techniques that are used; (some successfully and some that are not) unfortunately it is common that the pilot monitoring may be distracted with checklists or preparing for the approach; especially if there was a runway change; during this period of heightened workload. During the debrief and discussion of the event with the First Officer I feel like we covered the event quite thoroughly and cleared up any confusion that might have been present.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
562,562,562,562,8894,I was flying direct to NORDK for the NORDK3 arrival into SLC. As I neared NORDK waypoint ATC advised me of a reroute which was direct LHO for the LHO3 arrival and to descend to 16000. I complied and started my descent from FL220. I was then advised to turn 15 degrees right due to metering into SLC; I complied. I stayed on this heading for some time before ATC advised me that metering into SLC was taken care of and that I was now cleared direct to LHO and to resume the LHO3 arrival. I complied with a left turn to LHO. Upon crossing LHO I descended to 14000 per the arrival. A short period after I descended I was asked to copy a phone number for a possible pilot [deviation]; I complied. I continued the remainder arrival which ended with a visual approach to RWY 34L without incident. I disembarked my passengers and phoned the telephone number. A gentlemen answered and I identified myself; from there he explained to me what I had done. I was cleared direct LHO and to resume the LHO3 arrival not descend via the LHO3. He asked if there was anything I would like to add to the situation to which I said that I misunderstood the controller's clearance. I added that nothing was unusual with the flight and everything was normal. Looking back at this situation I should have asked for clarification on altitude and I also think given the situation ATC could have said something to the effect of; 'metering into SLC is no longer a factor you are now cleared direct LHO and resume the LHO3 arrival maintain 16000.',"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
563,563,563,563,7029,On climb out our CAS system displayed 'PTRIM NML FAIL'; 'SWPS FAULT'; 'FLAP FAIL'; 'PTRIM BKP FAIL' all in yellow. Along with 'SPOILER FAULT' in white. At the same time the autopilot disconnected on its own. First Officer was pilot flying 'PF' and I was pilot monitoring 'PM'. [First Officer] immediately noticed the loss of autopilot and took control. As we were cleared to FL270 we continued climb as we discussed what we had going on. After acknowledging what we had displayed; I thought best to have [the First Officer] do the checklist items while I would fly and handle radios. [The First Officer] has a lot more experience with the Phenom and better systems knowledge to boot. I am a High mins Captain. With scattered thunderstorms ahead; over 300 miles to go until destination and in VFR conditions; we elected to return to [departure airport]. As we were now landing no flaps with a return to departure airport I told [ATC] we were returning. [The First Officer] ran all pertinent checklists and found that we needed a longer runway than [departure airport] had with a no flap landing configuration. I elected to go to [a different alternate] and [the First Officer] concurred. ATC helped greatly with information pertaining to runway length; weather and easy commands with clearance limits. As in direct to the airport and descents. I had the passenger lead come up front and explained our situation; she asked how long until touchdown and returned to her seat. [The First Officer] made a call to company and explained our situation. Once that was done [the First Officer] ran the checklists a second time and confirmed we had things straight. With the runway in sight; [the First Officer] ran the no flap landing checklist. What we missed during the checklists was the 'PTRIM NML FAIL' going away; [the First Officer] noticed this and asked me to try the electric trim. It worked normally but with no indication as that display was 'X' out. This helped immensely as the controls were getting heavy as was expected. Landing was as expected; high pitch attitude; fast approach and landing speed; with long roll out. Approximately 8-9000 ft of runway. I was easy on the braking though. We were met by numerous airport fire rescue as we taxied off. Taxi to [FBO] was done normally. We disembarked our passengers and baggage. I talked to a firefighter who was filling out a report. We waited with the passengers till the recovery aircraft arrived.It has come to our attention that this fault is caused by a computer failure that is becoming more common place in our fleet. In my past fleets; I had maybe 2 control issues in 13 years. We had two this week. One was a ground spoiler fail; the second being this event. If there is a way to preempt these issues; it should be taken. I was aware after the fact of becoming a little tunnel-visioned to hand flying the plane when I detected the control pressures changing. At one point I was having to pull upwards of 30 pounds of force depending on speed. Control became easier with both hands until electric trim was restored. This was definitely a distraction for my attention. Having good CRM was apparent and immensely important with my attention taken to flying an unconfigured plane. First Officer kept me in the loop and informed with checklist statuses. This was important to timing needs and when we could land safely.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
564,564,564,564,2424,Departed ZZZ for ZZZ1 for repositioning. After takeoff on initial climb; the terrain alert sounds 'loudly'. 'TERRAIN' 'PULL UP' 'PULL UP'. This was a surprise and a distraction; I was told to climb to 2500/Heading 140. I had the autopilot on and engage and all instruments were reading accurately. However it was disturbing to be in IMC/Dark and getting this type of alert. Flying the Plane first; I was unable to switch to Departure in a timely manner; and dealing with this alert; I passed my altitude and continued climbing; as she keep saying pull up. I was finally able to contact Departure who was aware I was having trouble; as I told Departure Tower-to let them know I was having trouble and unable to call at this moment. Settled level 4000 and still on assigned heading; and all was fine again. No more alerts; until descent into my destination airport. It started again descending through 3000. As I was confident in the instruments I ignored the alerts; but it was still a distraction. After landing; and calling Field Service; we discovered it was not the plane at all! It was my device that had an EFB Garmin Pilot; that was bluetooth to my headset that was giving me the alerts. My lesson: Pilots need to verify that portable EFBs that are bluetooth connected to headsets are properly workings or not turned on.

After rescanning the situation and finding a conflict; I decided to change my course of action. At this point; Aircraft X depicted that it was descending out of FL353. I then instructed Aircraft X; 'Aircraft X; Amend altitude; descend and maintain FL350.'

During these patterns; ZZZ Tower was having a conversation with [another aircraft]; about performing 360 over [a reporting point] outside the Class D airspace and how that could cause an issue with traffic coming into the airspace. When the conversation ended; at about my third pattern on upwind; I see a Skyhawk over [another reporting point]; and the controller was yelling '[Aircraft Y]; are you on frequency!' That crew replied; 'yes; we are;' Tower replied; 'you entered the Delta without contacting me.' I believe during that conversation; initially there was an Archer heading southbound outside the pattern to enter traffic pattern for [Runway] XXL. The crew's actions resulted in the pattern flow disturbed. The crew in the Aircraft Z heading south turned and climbed into the pattern to avoid Aircraft Y. We continued our upwind.

571,571,571,571,2512,While flying over ZZZ VOR and joining the ZZZZZ arrival into ZZZ; we encountered severe turbulence while descending through flight levels 320-290. The event lasted approximately 2 mins and we exceeded the Mach limit for the aircraft. The seat belt sign was on and the Captain had given the FA's (Flight Attendants) a PA to take their seats approximately 2 minutes before the event based on a 'bumpy' ride report on descent from ATC. Upon entering the turbulence; the autopilot disconnected and we experienced +/- 1500 fpm on the VSI; +/- 60 kts. of airspeed and 25 degree rolls left and right. No injuries were reported by any of the passengers; however a couple of our FA may have strained their backs or necks trying to get their service carts stowed and into their seats. We believe that we encountered a severe wind shear as we had a 131 kts tailwind when we began our descent and when we finally came out of the turbulence it was a 50 kts crosswind.

572,572,572,572,9538,[I] was cruising at 10;500 ft. msl. Having just past the PMD VOR northbound and on a heading of 315; I was in the vicinity of WJF when I encountered wake turbulence from an aircraft. There were no traffic alerts or advisories; however 3 military aircraft were seen. One; a C130; was crossing west to east and ~1;000 ft. lower than us. Two others; estimated to be a C5A and a KC135; were turning south and would pass off our left wing approximately 5 miles to the west. I assumed they were descending on approach to Edwards AFB as this is along a straight line from this position.None of these aircraft passed in front of us nor were at the same altitude us.[I] encountered wake turbulence [and] was immediately rolled inverted and to the right approximately 270 degrees of roll. To recover from this upset I continued the roll to a wings level attitude; but the nose was ~ 30 degrees low (below the horizon) and we were on a course of 253. The recovery was normal and the forward airspeed did not exceed 180 kts. Vne for this aircraft is 220 kts. and Va is 182 kts.We contacted Joshua Approach and informed them of our upset; saying we had just done a uncommanded 'barrel roll' and had recovered. There were no injuries to passengers nor damage to the aircraft. After recovery we regained our cruising altitude of 10;500 ft. msl but overshot when I misread the altimeter and reset the autopilot.During the upset we were using an autopilot which did not disengage during the event.We continued our flight and landed at our destination with no further problems. Subsequent checks showed no damage or loss of fuel or fluidsConsidering the number and type of aircraft operating in the vicinity of our flight; I believe we should have been alerted to the traffic and the possibility of wake turbulence in the vicinity.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
573,573,573,573,9971,During the Pecan 1A departure from Hong Kong; just after we rolled out of the turn to RAMEN at 220 knots; the Captain (pilot flying) called for slats retract. The first officer (Pilot Monitoring) repeated the command and moved the flap/slat handle to the slats retract position. As soon as the handle was moved the stick shaker activated. The Captain called 'slats extend'; the first officer extended the slats and the stick shaker stopped. We lost several hundred feet of altitude during the recovery. I was the International Relief Officer (IRO) on this flight. I had been focusing on our ground track as the mandatory overflight of PORPA resulted in going a bit wide of the FMS generated ground track during the departure turn from PORPA to RAMEN. As we rolled out and I saw that we were correcting to track; I looked down at the SID depiction on my [Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)]. When I heard the slats retract call; I immediately looked up and saw that we were still several miles short of RAMEN with a 220 knot speed restriction there. I then looked at the airspeed indicator (thinking that maybe I missed a 'high speed approved' call from ATC). We were still at 220 knots. The green slat retract (SR) on the airspeed indicator was obscured by the Gear Extend (GE) indication superimposed over it as the two speeds were almost identical. By the time I had processed this information and realized that we were still nearly 30 knots below slat retract speed (maybe 2 or 3 seconds); it was too late. The handle had been moved and the shaker was activated. Recommendations: First and foremost; this event illustrates the importance of the pilot monitoring verifying the limiting speed on the airspeed indicator before moving the flap/slat handle. This should continue to be discussed during recurring training. It is often said that the IRO has the best seat in the house when it comes to threat detection and mitigation as the IRO can devote 100% of his/her time to this activity. Obviously; I picked an unfortunate time to look down at my [EFB]. That being said; could I have processed the position and airspeed information more quickly and possibly avoided this incident? Perhaps. At this point I should mention that this duty day followed two near minimum crew rests (for both me and the Captain). An international rest of 12 or 13 hours is simply not enough time to travel from the airport to (an often distant) hotel and back; check in and out of the hotel; eat at least once--often twice; plug in our required electronics (iPads and phones); sync our iPads; check our email for scheduling advisories; shower; shave and sleep eight hours. Something has to be sacrificed and it's almost always sleep. When you factor in the inevitable transportation issues (late bus; traffic congestion; etc.) and hotel issues (room key doesn't work; room smells like cigarette smoke; etc) even more sleep is lost. While sleeping only six or six and a half hours may not necessitate calling in fatigued; it definitely resulted in me performing at less than 100%. [The company] needs to do their part in the fatigue mitigation process. Minimum or near-minimum rest periods (less than 15 hours) should be minimized and back to back minimum or near-minimum rest periods should be prohibited.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
574,574,574,574,4366,Flying back from ZZZ to ZZZ1 I decided to file and fly on an IFR flight plan due to possible unintended low visibility due to the bushfires. In cruise at 10000 ft. approaching ZZZZZ waypoint; the aircraft started to sink. My initial response was to increase power; reduce speed to initiate a climb. The sink rate continued and after then looking at my engine oil temp/pressure gauges; I was able to verify the sink was a big downdraft from the lee side of the mountains I was crossing and the aircraft was unable to out-climb it. As I was about to notify ATC; the controller contacted me first and asked if everything was all right. I let him know I had a downdraft and was unable to stop the descent. He very quickly gave me a block altitude to work with. During the next few minutes I configured the plane to best rate of climb and went through different ways to increase aircraft performance. Unfortunately none of these actions helped and I was quickly at the bottom of my block altitude. I then radioed and requested vectors to a lower MVA (Minimum Vectoring Altitude) and was promptly given a heading of a westerly direction. The controller then asked if I was VMC and in sight of the mountains and I responded yes. He then said if I was happy to cancel IFR he could give me a lower MVA VFR. I proceeded to cancel IFR and carried on the flight VFR under flight following. At this point I had been vectored away from the downdraft and was able to begin a climb again and carry on to my destination.I could not have been happier with the response from the controller and with great communication we were able to make a plan to avoid any dangerous situation. I have learned multiple things from this situation and will make sure I pass them on to as many others as I can. The main thing will be to take a non-mountainous route when there are strong winds forecasted and even though I was 3000 ft. above the highest point; downdrafts can still effect small piston aircraft.The other important lesson is to communicate as early as possible with ATC if any abnormality arises and if not on an IFR flight plan; always opt for VFR flight following so you are always in immediate contact with the correct controllers in any situation. I hope others can learn from this situation.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
575,575,575,575,5562,"I knew it was going to be a struggle getting out of ZZZ with all passengers on board when I saw the take-off performance. At 40C the margin between PTOW (Planned Take-off Weight) and MTOW was 1100 lbs. My First Officer (FO) was terrific; but it was his first trip since IOE; he had 18 hours on the airplane at the start of the sequence; and had not flown prior to training for about 8 months. In addition; it was only my second time flying the ZZZZZ departure; which has three at or above altitudes on it; which is a new thing in ZZZ.  I live in ZZZ; and consequently fly out of there a great deal.  All previous RNAV departures used to have at or below altitudes on them (to keep clear of inbound aircraft); so it never used to be an issue worrying about making altitudes on the SID.  At the aircraft; I was already concerned about two things: brake temps and having to bump passengers.  I asked my FO to pull us up numbers for 41 and 42C; just in case it got hotter; as it was likely to. In addition; I believe the winds were swinging around - runway XXR had a tailwind component at one point; so I was also looking for numbers for XYL; but due to terrain; the only runway that worked at all was XXR.  I noticed that we would be unable to make the restrictions and asked the FO to ask for altitude relief on the SID as soon as he contacted ground.  In my experience; asking for altitude relief at other airports was never an issue; so I was not overly concerned. We pushed back; and naturally were over PTOW.  I asked the FO to request a new take-off performance for 41 and 42C.  We eventually landed on a Flaps 1 take-off performance requiring thrust bump which got us legal for takeoff.  All this occurred during the short taxi from the terminal to runway XXR.By the time we reached number 1 holding short of the runway; I realized we had forgotten to ask for the altitude relief on the SID. I asked the FO to do so as we were taking the runway.  The controller; upon hearing the request; told us to taxi clear and get a new clearance.  By this time there were 6-8 aircraft in a queue for takeoff; and our brake temps were over 150 degrees.  My main concern was that if we had to leave the runway; it would get too hot to accommodate the load; and by the time we taxied for another 30 minutes; the brakes would be too hot for takeoff.  So; glancing down at the FMS; which showed that we would miss the altitude restrictions by 5-700 feet; I knew that if we delayed cleanup; we could easily make those restrictions.  I told the controller that we could manage the departure; and he again cleared us for takeoff.  I told my FO that since we were at the max performance envelope of the airplane; he should rotate very gently.  As we were rolling down the runway; my attention was fixed on the EGT; as I had not done a bump takeoff before; and the engines were exactly on the edge of the red.  He did as I asked; and as a result; we were very fast on the initial climb segment.  As we climbed out; I was fixated on the altitude.  Once it became clear that the 5;000 ft altitude (I think around 4;500 feet MSL) I relaxed a bit and told him we could clean up.  He set climb power (which was a much greater reduction than normal due to the thrust bump) and I reached for the flap lever and set flaps up.  At this time we were still wings level.  I was so fixated on the altitude; and our airspeed shortly after takeoff was so much higher than usual that I didn't take a good look at the airspeed indicator.  I believe that I retracted the flaps very early. VLS (lowest selectable speed) jumped by perhaps 40 knots; and we ended up about 20 knots below VLS.  Naturally; we were now facing rapidly rising terrain; and the SID commanded a right turn.  My FO started to turn; and now instead of being below VLS; we were in alpha floor.  I instructed my FO to lower the nose; but it wasn't happening quickly enough; so I grabbed the side stick and pushed the nose over; at the same time requesting him to let go.  There was a momentary DUAL INPUT"" annunciation and a momentary noticeable low speed buffet which lasted perhaps a second.  We lost perhaps 300 feet of altitude as I got the airspeed back.  We were able to make all of the altitude restrictions and I don't believe there were any deviations from the SID.  Once we recovered; the only other item remaining was how to get the auto throttles out of alpha floor.  Eventually; we turned them off (match and mash) and back on again and that got the system back to normal.I was using my knowledge of past experience flying the old SIDs.  They didn't have airspeed or at or above altitudes; and my experience in the past that asking for altitude relief on a SID was not a big deal.  In addition; I was flying with a brand new (very sharp) but inexperienced FO; who was relying entirely on my experience.  I was also pushing to accommodate the load without having to remove passengers and/or cargo; and was worried about the brake temp issues; causing me to push to get off the ground as soon as possible.I made several errors.  The first one was not notifying clearance delivery early of our inability to make the altitude and/or airspeed restrictions on the SID.  In the past; ZZZ used to have a procedure for A321 aircraft to delay climb power/flap retraction to 3;000 AGL.  I think if we had used that procedure; we probably would have been able to make the altitude and speed restrictions on the SID.  That procedure is gone.  Second; when we finally did request relief on the SID (by this time we were on the runway) and the controller told us to clear the runway and get a new clearance; I should have done so; even if it had caused us further problems with brake temp and/or takeoff weight.  Third; having taken the decision to take off because I was certain we could delay cleanup; thus making us legal for the SID; I should have taken over flying duties.  This would have alleviated my FO's task saturation; as I was far more experienced in the airplane.  This would still have been sub-optimal; but I am confident the takeoff would have been uneventful.   Fourth; once I retracted the flaps and we were below VLS; I should have put the flaps back to Config 1.  So; there were many errors on my part; but an early intervention with clearance delivery would have solved everything.  I believe there should be a warning to the A320 Fleet about the new SIDS; and that at high temperatures careful note should be taken of the danger of not being able to make altitude restrictions on any SID with at or above altitudes; especially early in the SID; and that relief should be requested at the gate with clearance delivery. Also to note: green dot speed (min maneuver) was 245 with flaps up; so the only way to maintain 230 knot speed at ZZZZZ waypoint is at config 1.  Again; the old requirement to clean up at 3000 AGL would have solved this.""","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

578,578,578,578,2406,I was the FLM performing a skill check on a developmental. We had just taken the position and had a few traffic situations that he had fallen behind on. Aircraft X; a Runway XX departure; was climbing on a vector/classic SID. Air Carrier Y was a [Runway] YYR departure that was on a RNAV SID. Both aircraft meet at a way point called ZZZZZ. Air Carrier Y was overtaking Aircraft X. Aircraft X was turned eastbound; climbed; and [then] stopped once we realized the overtake. Traffic was called to the trailing aircraft; Air Carrier Y; but he was already above Aircraft X and he couldn't see him. Loss of separation occurred. In addition; the trainee told Air Carrier Y to climb via the SID; which means to cross ZZZZZ below 7;000 FT. Air Carrier Y stated; 'Roger; cleared unrestricted to FL190.' Trainee did not catch the read back error; nor did I. We had a couple of difficult situations that we were dealing with at the time. Had Air Carrier Y stopped the climb at 7;000 FT; there would have been no loss of separation. I feel that these 'climb via' on the RNAV SIDs cause more confusion. Some aircraft are climbing to 7;000 FT only and some are climbing via the SID; this is confusing. If all aircraft came off climbing to the same altitude and let the Departure Controller climb them; traffic permitting; this [might] not have happened.

579,579,579,579,3701,We were scheduled for departure from SFO. We received our clearance which was the NITE 3 RNAV Departure with the GRTFL transition; climb via the SID OED as filed. We loaded the departure and Dlt. plan into the FMS along with FL 190 into the altitude alerter which is the altitude for the NITE 3. Before taxi we both reviewed the NITE 3 departure and verified the FMS had the correct information; speeds; altitudes; and headings. This early it wasn't very busy yet so we requested with ground control a departure off of 28R to save the long taxi time all the way over to 01R (usually 15 minutes or more). Ground control gave us taxi instructions to 28R intersection Echo for the takeoff runway; then as we were taxing ground control gave us a new departure clearance. The new clearance was; change departure to the SNTNA 2 RNAV departure climb via the SID. I was in the right seat working the radios and within seconds we were on taxiway Charlie; I told the pilot flying 'my heads down I'm changing the box'. I entered the new runway 28R along with the new SID SNTNA 2. It looked almost identical to the NITE 3 at first glance: 284 degree heading a couple of right turns and then out to GRTFL. We ran our checklists and arrived at taxiway Echo holding short of 28R; ground told us we would have to hold short for a few minutes. The pilot flying picked up his iPad and started to review the departure procedure. We were cleared for takeoff before he finished his review; which would have caught the altitude change in the departure procedure; which was 3;000 feet instead of 19;000 feet. Also there was a procedure off of 28R on the NITE3 that went to 19;000 feet. So to put it mildly we had 19;000 feet stuck in our brain; so to speak. The aircraft was lightly loaded; temperature was cool; sky clear; so we climbed rapidly and were handed over to Norcal departure. I told them we were climbing out of 2;000FT. for FL 190. 15 seconds later the controller came back and gave us a squawk. I told him we were. 36 seconds later the controller came back with 'radar contact 4 west of the airport; what was your assigned altitude?' I replied 190. He said we should have been assigned 3;000 and then cleared us to 10;000. Then he asked if we didn't get the except and maintain 3;000 portion of that clearance? I said no they never gave it to us. That was the last we heard about it till we were handed of to Oakland center and we received the dreaded call this number when you land; which we did. In the mean time we thoroughly reviewed the SNTNA 2 and saw the 3;000Ft. altitude restriction at that point we realized the confusion we had with departure control. We discussed the situation with the Tracon manager explained our being rushed and not having enough time to review the SID and brief it. She told us there were no traffic conflicts; but it would still have to be investigated.My recommendation is two part. First when given a last minute change the controller should also state the altitude restrictions. Second the charts should be reformatted and the altitude restrictions placed in big letters under the name of the SID along with the runways that are already listed at the top of some of the SIDs. As important as an altitude is they should be printed in RED!There were probably several contributing factors creating the incident. One was it was early in the morning at least for us as a crew. I'm not sure of the controller's schedule. The biggest issue was being rushed; which is never good. We only had 6 minutes from brake release to lift off; that's not a big deal in this aircraft; but with runway changes; plus a departure change; it appears it was just a little too much for highly experienced crew. I'm guessing between the both of us were looking at 40;000 plus hours of experience. Something is seriously wrong with the system for this to happen to a well-trained experienced crew seriously concerned about the safety of the system in this critical information is being presented to crews. Something MUST be changed.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
580,580,580,580,6453,I was the Captain on the flight and was acting as PM; while the FO was the PF on this leg.  While descending in the arrival (was not descend via; simply following the arrival procedure); the aircraft was at FL80 (transition level was FL70) and was given a clearance to descend to altitude 5;000 feet on QNH of 995 mb.  The PF made the descent to altitude 5;000 feet and leveled.  ATC then made a call to us to maintain 5;000 feet.  I responded roger; maintaining 5;000 feet.  ATC then made another call to us that they showed us at 4;500 feet and to maintain 5;000 feet.  It was at that point that I realized our altimeters were still set to QNE 1013 mb.  We immediately made the correction and informed ATC of our incorrect altimeter setting.  They replied and said this would have to be a mandatory report of altitude deviation.  Looking back at this occurrence; there are a number of factors that caused this from my own errors and complacency.  This is a perfect example of the Swiss cheese model with all the holes lining up to this occurrence.  The factors are as follows:1.  Unnecessary distraction:  During cruise flight; I noticed the routing for our next Oceanic leg had an error.  I made a Satcom call to our flight planning provider to correct the problem.  As we descended above FL100; I made a radio call to the ground handler requesting services for our quick turn.  I then realized I forgot to mention to the handler that we needed them to print a hard copy of the new flight plan I had requested earlier with our flight plan provider.  Now level at FL80 on the STAR; I told the PF I was leaving the frequency again to call the local handler about printing our flight plan.  I knew better; and never should have left my PM duties below FL100.  Trying to avoid ground delays for flight plan delivery was simply not worth sacrificing removal of the PM.  It was at this time when I was off frequency that the PF took the radio call for the descent to altitude 5;000 feet without changing altimeter settings to QNH 995.  Had I remained on task; there would have been another set of eyes and ears to prevent this.2.  Electronic checklist:  I used the electronic checklist appropriately and all items were completed; crew briefing etc.  On the Approach Checklist; I had even left the one final item open and highlighted/displayed on the CAS which was 'Altimeters/Trans Alt'.  But again; due to getting distracted by leaving the frequency; I did not clear that final item of the checklist when leaving the transition level of FL70.  This checklist was in full view of us on the CAS when ATC first began calling about our altitude; but I missed it.3.  Improper Trans Alt in FMS:  The Honeywell FMS in the GIV allows for the setting of a transition altitude within the PERF feature.  The FMS then considers all altitudes above this setting to be FL's; and below this number are treated as altitudes.  The advantage to proper use of this feature is that the crew will receive an FMS scratch pad message stating 'check baro' if the barometer is set improperly when climbing or descending through the transition alt programmed into the FMS.  During cruise flight and prior to being able to receive ATIS with the current Transition Level; I entered the transition altitude from the STAR chart and placed it in the transition altitude selection within the FMS.  I never should have made that selection.  When descending; the Transition Level should always be set in the FMS.  When departing/climbing; transition altitude should be programmed in the FMS.  In this case; the transition level was FL70.  Had I set that number; we would have received a scratch pad message when leaving FL70 to 'check baro'.  Because I had set 5;000 feet; which happened to be our assigned altitude; we never got the alert because we hadn't yet descended through 5;000 feet as improperly set in the FMS. With the exception of the United States; most countries have a transition layer of at least 1;000 feet between the transition altitude and ATC assigned transition level.  Had I setup the FMS properly; we would have had a buffer between FL70 and the transition altitude of 5;000 feet to receive our FMS 'check baro' notification. Both myself and the PF missed the QNH altimeter setting.  Two professional pilots didn't get the proper setting due to a number of factors that individually would not be a big deal.  But when added up; these factors took away the many mitigation strategies we have to keep this from happening.  There are a couple areas that we could make improvements in our SOPs to prevent this in the future.  We need to learn and get better from this unfortunate event.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

582,582,582,582,6901,We were cleared to join the transition to the TEJAS4 STAR into IAH; and issued a clearance to climb from 11;000 ft to 17;000 ft. The Autopilot was on. I heard [Houston] Center give a traffic report to a [military] trainer; an '[Aircraft] out of 11 for 17' which I assumed was us. Center did not advise us of the traffic; but I was looking for it and I saw the traffic on the TCAS; descending and converging. Just before 12;000 ft. we had a TCAS TA then RA; at one point commanding vertical speed in excess of 3;000 fpm. The TCAS indicator was a red square; well inside the 3 mile ring on the TCAS screen and converging to our location. It appeared the [military trainer] was descending right on top of us; much like the TCAS avoidance exercise in recurrent training. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and pushed the nose down; taking evasive action as the TCAS commanded a high rate of descent to avoid collision. We announced our TCAS descent to Houston Center. After the event was over; we continued our climb to 17;000 ft. I queried the controller regarding the event. The [military trainer] pilot stated he had visual with us the entire time which I find dubious as we were far too close. At one point the TCAS indicated 300 ft. vertical separation.  We did not have a visual with the [military trainer]; largely due to the fact that he was approaching from our right side and was obscured by the rising sun. The Flight Attendant confirmed no injuries to passengers or herself and everyone was seated. I am unsure if the [military trainer] is equipped with TCAS; as the aircraft made no observable attempt to climb as would be expected when both aircraft are equipped with TCAS.Both ATC and the other pilot made critical errors in separation.

584,584,584,584,9052,While on an instrument approach to runway 06L at CLE; we experienced a loss of LOC and GS prior to the final approach fix (Sasco int) and Hados intersection. We were established on the LOC and GS was intercepting; descending out of 3000 feet when the aircraft began to pitch up and down with the autopilot engaged. We noticed the LOC frequency on Nav 1 had change to a VOR frequency (108.??); the LOC and GS pointers were going left to right full scale on the LOC and up and down full scale on the GS. The autopilot began chasing the GS causing the airplane to change pitch up and down; gradually increasing in intensity. I told the First officer we were going missed as I disengaged the auto pilot to hand fly the airplane and execute the missed approach. Before I disengaged the autopilot; the airplane had pitched up and I disengaged the autopilot applied forward pressure to level off. The First Officer called ATC and reported we were executing the missed approach. We were instructed to climb to 3000 feet on an assigned heading. At the time we were approximately at 3400 feet and with the trim that the autopilot had applied; we were climbing at a pretty good rate. By the time I got the trim out and the airplane descending to 3000 feet; we were at 4200 feet. ATC came back and instructed us to maintain 4000 feet. We maintain the heading of the alternate missed approach instructions but not our altitude do to the pitch attitude of the airplane and the back pressure applied by the autopilot. Once I had a feel of the airplane we maintained 4000 feet and proceeded to get vectored around for the ILS to 06R this time instead of 06L. We informed ATC of the loss of navigation (LOC and GS) on the ILS for 06L as the reason for the missed approach. After landing on Runway 06R; tower controller apologized about the issue with the ILS and mentioned they received an alert regarding the ILS at the same time we called the missed approached. The ILS for 06L was then NOTAM inop.  It appears there was an issue with the ILS signal that cause the Collins Pro Line to lose the LOC frequency and revert or default to the VOR frequency. We had not yet extended the gear or full flaps at the time of losing the GS. I preformed the missed and failed to notice the FO had not retracted the flaps from Approach to the Up position; while descending back down to the originally assigned 3000 feet altitude; we received instructions to maintain 4000 feet. I believe this contributed to us climbing at a higher rate than I expected making it more difficult to maintain and descended to the originally assigned 3000 feet. It was during the After Takeoff/Go Around checklist that the flaps were noticed at the Approach position.I feel I could have abandoned the approach a few seconds sooner and this may have prevented the airplane from chasing the glide slope to the point of pitching up and down as much as it did and adding so much nose up elevator pressure and trim. I should have checked the flap position sooner and that may have helped me maintain altitude sooner and with less deviation.

I then got a visual on the landing light of this traffic and it was indeed heading toward us at nearly our assigned altitude.

591,591,591,591,1395,While on descent in to ZZZ; I the CA was PF.  We received a different runway assignment than anticipated.  We were cleared to 'cross ZZZZZ at 3;000 feet; cleared the ILS [Runway] XXR approach ZZZ.'  The runway change was made in the FMS from YYR to XXR.  While in VNAV path and cleared for the approach we set FAF Glideslope intercept altitude of 2;000 feet in the altitude window.  The last-minute change left us a bit high so we lowered the landing gear and selected LVL CHG in order to re-intercept the path.  ZZZZZ the IF was in the FMS twice and while trying to correct that and heads down and distracted (because we were no longer in VNAV) the aircraft descended through 3;000 feet towards the 2;000 feet set in the ALT window.  I caught the mistake at approximately 2;600 feet MSL and leveled off until intercepting the glide path.  There was no correction from ATC; no known traffic conflict etc.  Normal uneventful landing.

592,592,592,592,2637,We were assigned a final vector to join the localizer; told to maintain 2;600 until established and cleared for the ILS 16L into HEF. We presently were at 3;000 and set to join the localizer between GIGEY (cross at 3;000) and DORGE (cross at 2;200). I set 2;600 (or what I recall being 2;600). I told the PF we were 'good to 2;600' and I verified the approach was armed by the PF on the autopilot control panel and verified the annunciation on his PFD. I believe it was about this time he called for Flaps 20. I remember thinking it was a little early for that because of the standard profile for an ILS; but selected Flaps 20 since it was not really an issue to configure early. I think we continued to configure for the approach during this time which means I was running the Before Landing checklist and was distracted with those duties. Potomac Approach contacted us with a low altitude alert showing 1;600 instead of 2;600 and gave the altimeter setting. This was the first time I noticed we were at 1;600 instead of 2;600. I confirmed with Potomac we were indeed at 1;600 and we're going back to 2;600. I selected a higher altitude in the pre-selector (2;300) because we were close to DORGE at that time so we climbed up to capture the glide slope before DORGE. We intercepted the glide slope and landed without further event. One of 2 things occurred: Either I set 1;600 instead of 2;600 or the PF selected 1;600 from the 2;600 I set; not realizing I had already set the altitude. Regardless of how the improper altitude was selected; this can be prevented by both pilots verbally confirming any altitude selections.

They reported weather and that she expected a visual approach and asked for a fix on the RNAV approach to set up for it. I didn't know the fix; but since 11;000 feet was the highest terrain in the area; I told them they could start heading toward the fix while I found it. They turned direct and began descending below 11;000 feet. I first noticed it at 10;500 feet. I asked them to say altitude. They reported 10;500 feet descending to I think 7;200 feet. The fix in question has an altitude of 7;200 feet if you are cleared for the RNAV approach. I gave them a low altitude alert; informed them that they were cleared only to 11;000 feet and told them to climb immediately to 11;000 feet.

598,598,598,598,537,First; some background information. My area is currently at a staffing level that affects safety on a daily basis. We consistently do not have enough people to safely staff a shift but are forced to work around it and do our jobs as best we can. Most of us; myself included; are working 6-day workweeks on a regular basis. This week for me was no exception. My first shift of the week; [Day 1]; was short staffed. [Day 2] was even worse. I made two requests for earlier shifts on [Day 2] in order to get more rest on my quick turn; among other reasons; but both were denied. During one rotation; I went over 2 hours on position. I was worn out and burned out. [Day 2] evening I went home and my child was ill. [Day 2] night; I put in a request for one hour of leave for [Day 3] morning in order to help care for my sick child. I didn't sleep well and kept checking web schedule overnight to see if it had been approved.It was addressed around [late]; at which point I was already leaving for work. The request was denied and I was frustrated. Lately it is difficult to maintain family life with the inability to change shifts or get leave. This was just one more example on a heap of hundreds of examples in the last year. I arrived to work and sat on position for about 1 hour and 55 minutes my first round; which did not help to curb my frustrations at the situation. When I got to work; we had two supervisors and both were plugged in. They were using one of our controllers to staff CIC (Controller in Charge). All of this to say that during the time of the event I was distracted by a year's worth of staffing issues; being tired; and my child being sick. I took sector XX at XA:07. I knew when I took the position there were several items needing addressed right away: I had around 7 departures to transition; ZZZ spacing to achieve; a slow TBM needing routing and a climb; a slow ZZZ1 arrival underneath a faster ZZZ2 arrival that needed swapped out; etc. However I didn't have time to address any of this because literally 1 second after I gave my initials; I was told via landline call from [another] sector that they were handing me off a medical emergency aircraft; Aircraft X returning to [Departure airport] and descending to 28;000 feet. The aircraft was in a terrible spot; right on top of a slew of departures. I got control from the sector. At this point; I had trouble coming up with a solid plan whereas usually I would be able to easily make a plan. I attribute this to the aforementioned background influences leading up to this event. Aircraft X checked on and requested a turn for [the Airport]. Because I didn't have a better plan yet; I issued a westbound heading of 250 so the aircraft at least wouldn't be going in the complete opposite direction of [the airport]. I descended the aircraft to 24;000 feet and began coordinating with approach control. My supervisor was aware of the emergency (I believe another sector controller told him). He was standing next to the sector from when I took the handoff on the emergency; until after the event took place; to my knowledge. Aircraft X had an aircraft below him; Aircraft Y; a departure climbing to 21;000 feet. My priority was to get the emergency aircraft lower so I attempted to stop another aircraft; Aircraft Z; at 18;000 feet so that when separation was achieved between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y via the Aircraft X's heading; I could safely descend Aircraft X to 19;000 feet. However; I didn't have communication on Aircraft Z so I had to coordinate yet again and change the plan. I descended Aircraft X to 22;000 feet (he read it back correctly); and handed him off to approach control with their control reference Aircraft Y underneath. I switched communication at XA:11; 4 minutes after taking the position and the handoff on the aircraft. I didn't get a chance to put the new assigned altitude in the data block and by the time I realized it; approach control had the handoff and my workload was too heavy.While this was all going on; the amount of workload for the sector had gotten to a crazy level and I remember wondering why the Supervisor didn't give me an assist Controller to do all the coordinating I was doing; but I didn't have a moment to stop and ask. Especially because while I was trying to keep airplanes separated and manage the sector; the Supervisor was in my other ear continually asking me questions and trying to get me to get more information about the emergency from the pilot. I truly felt like I didn't have a second to spare; and I got the information I could and then switched the Aircraft X to approach control.The Supervisor had been bugging me to ask if the passenger was a male or a female and at that point; I just couldn't handle any more distractions so I switched the aircraft thinking approach control could get more information when there was time; whereas I didn't have the time. I was frustrated at the Supervisor for adding a distraction of persistent questioning when really I needed help; but I tried to push past this and continue to do my job. Just before the event; the complexity of the sector involved: multiple aircraft checking on and stepping on each other; a ZZZ1 departure in confliction with ZZZ1 arrivals; a ZZZ1 arrival in confliction with an ZZZ2 arrival and another faster ZZZ1 arrival behind; and other aircraft needing attention. I remember seeing the Aircraft X data block reflecting the aircraft being at 22;000 feet; the assigned altitude. At XA:11:58 the AIRCRAFT X showed a hit of 21300 feet. I saw this hit a few seconds later. At this time the AIRCRAFT X was 1.78 miles and 300 feet from the Aircraft Y according to replay. At the time just before this hit; I had 4-6 aircraft checking on at once and a phone call that I was attempting to sort out. My brain when it saw the first hit did not comprehend what it was showing. I irrationally thought maybe it was a bad hit or maybe approach control was using visual separation (yes I know this is not possible at this altitude; but as I said; my initial thoughts were irrational). While my brain was trying to process what I was seeing; I switched an aircraft to another frequency; kind of on auto-pilot. Around 5 seconds after I noticed the first hit; the second hit showed the Aircraft X at 20;600 feet and that's when it hit me that the aircraft was actually descending. On this hit; the aircraft were .72 miles and 400 feet according to Falcon. It bothers me that it took me those 5 seconds to process the event. I should have called traffic immediately to the Aircraft Y. By the time I had processed; it was too late and the Aircraft X was already showing 400 feet below the Aircraft Y and in a rapid descent. I called approach control to ask what the AIRCRAFT X was doing and the controller said the Aircraft X said he had been assigned 20;000 feet; which was not the case according to the replay review. At the time of the event; I was looking at approximately 20 data blocks on my scope. After the event took place; The Supervisor who had witnessed the event; asked if I wanted to be pulled off position. This was well-intentioned but yet another distraction. I was too busy to give the sector to another controller for about 10 more minutes; when I was more caught up and could give a position relief briefing. The Supervisor  reviewed the replay with me afterwards. He said they would be asking him why there was no Assist Controller and he wanted me to agree with him that the sector had not been busy and that I hadn't needed one until the event and by that time it was too late; or something to that effect. I couldn't agree with him; but I don't know if he would have gotten one there in time had I had the chance to ask for one; as the whole event occurred in less than 5 minutes after taking the position.We need better staffing. We need more overtime budget allowed because every day we have less staffing than we can safely manage in our area and are told thatmore controllers will not be called in on overtime. We need supervisors that can recognize a bad situation and staff the sectors appropriately. We need less time on position so we are not constantly burned out and fatigued. As for me; I need to recognize better when I'm not as rested as I could be. I need to take the time to ask for an Assist when things get critical. I need to remember to issue a safety alert. I need to not let distractions get in the way of doing my job. I am haunted by this event and will take many lessons from it. I don't know or understand why TCAS didn't go off for the Aircraft Y. That is supposed to be our fail-safe. I don't know if it went off for the Aircraft X.

The paper chart has OHLAA depicted inside the 162nm mile; the electronic one does not. The first version of the electronic data was even worse; depicting portions of AR23 outside the 162nm line. The paper chart depicts the line as a curve; which to me makes more sense; since the coast is not a series of straight lines. The JeppFD depiction is a straight line.

604,604,604,604,8094,The event began during the takeoff roll. The Captain was the Pilot Flying and advanced the thrust levers normally. As the aircraft began accelerating; his charts binder became unstable [in its] bracket and began to fall rearward due to accelerating forces. While trying to handle the control yoke; thrust levers and generally control the aircraft during the takeoff; he attempted to catch the binder and place it back on the bracket. During this time we accelerated through 80 knots and shortly thereafter through rotation speed. The Captain did rotate after the 'V1; Rotate' call; but his binder was still not settled. We were assigned [a] departure...and made the initial turn to a heading of 039 and then 060 passing 500 feet. Still trying to get the binder back on the bracket; the Captain engaged the autopilot with LNAV. Now past the 500 foot; 060 heading turn; the next instruction is to turn left heading 290 reaching 4 DME.... With the LNAV engaged; the aircraft began correcting to the right. At the same time ATC gave us a left turn to heading 220 as the Captain was still trying to right his book and operate the autopilot. Throughout the ordeal the Captain had become increasingly agitated. I had a hard time understanding the heading assigned by ATC due to the Captain's struggle and initially read back 020; but promptly corrected to heading 220 by confirming with ATC. At that point; ATC requested we keep the turn tight to the left. Having received that instruction the Captain grabbed his binder and forcefully threw it behind him; then grabbed the yoke and rapidly rolled the aircraft to the left; pulling back on the yoke and for a second to a second and a half; the stick shaker activated. The Captain quickly recovered and shallowed out his initial corrections. The remainder of the flight was uneventful....I have had similar incidents happen to me on takeoff; whether it's the checklist or my binder falling; I let it go because flying the aircraft is my first priority as the pilot flying. The PM should have the same information out and available if I need to ask anything or correct me if need be. There are two of us for a reason and that is to back each other up. If the Captain had just let his binder go or maybe even transferred controls for a moment if so distracted; I doubt any of this would have happened. The Captain failed to prioritize his workload during this event.

605,605,605,605,1113,I filed IFR to HHR. Departure Tower handed me off to Approach. Approach gave me vectors for my climb to 5;000 MSL. Upon reaching altitude; Approach gave me direct an airway fix and handed me off to SCT Approach. I contacted SCT Approach after they acknowledged me; I then requested the GPS/WAAS approach for HHR. The Controller asked me to repeat the approach and then said OK. I made the same request with all subsequent controller handoffs. On contacting the last SCT Approach Controller prior to be handed off to Tower; he cleared me for the Localizer/GPS approach. I advised him I was direct WELLZ Intersection and had previously requested the GPS/WAAS approach and I was requesting the GPS/WAAS approach from him. While WELLZ is also on the localizer course; in GPS steering mode on autopilot; the GPS was warning of the upcoming steep turn ahead and was preparing for the turn. The vectors given by controllers for my course heading put me on a narrow downwind to the final approach course. The Controller stated that the approach was unable and to fly the Localizer/GPS approach. I had the localizer approach frequencies set up in my back up NAV 2. I use NAV 2 as a double check to NAV 1 which was in GPS steering mode coupled to the autopilot. I was in IMC at the time and did not want to argue with the Controller that the previous controllers had accepted my request for the GPS approach which is what my autopilot was flying. I began to transition from the GPS approach to the localizer approach. I had not briefed the localizer approach and was working to bring up the approach plate. The Controller called up and said I was 2 miles from HASHY and said to maintain 1;600 FT till established cleared for Localizer/GPS approach all while I was in IMC. I changed the autopilot from GPS steering mode to heading mode. I tuned in a left turn on the autopilot heading mode. The airplane autopilot turns at a standard rate turn. The Controller called and stated [that] I needed to make a much steeper turn to make the localizer. I disconnected the autopilot and I cranked the yoke over to the left and watched the localizer come in on NAV 2. Controller called in and stated he observed me established on the localizer. I didn't think I was established due to the extreme bank and I thought my momentum was going to take me past the localizer which is why I had not yet started my descent and I made no report of being established. I reached down to reset the GPS to HHR when I noticed the Multi Function Display which receives its information from the GPS screen was blank and the previous programmed procedure in the GPS flight plan was now gone. I tried to program the GPS for HHR and I got GPS integrity error. I had no way points; no airports; no intersections on my MFD; nor my electronic HSI moving map which are both driven by the GPS which had apparently had no signal. Further; the GPS is my DME and I had no reference to distance from airport or waypoints. I changed my EFIS from map mode to Localizer mode so I could have my full Localizer needle on the HSI in front of me over using the number two NAV needles. In this short period of time of resetting radios in IMC; and trying to figure out what happened to my GPS; MFD and EFIS along with the momentum of my tight turn caused me to drift 10% right. I got a call from the Controller warning me of the deviation in which case I turned 10% left as requested by the Controller. After the Controller saw my course correction; he asked me to contract Hawthorne Tower. After landing; I was instructed to call a number for which I was informed of a possible pilot deviation. As a result; I was informed that the Controller for LAX adjusted traffic for three arriving flights into LAX. When I heard this; I thought this was strange; since I had no traffic alerts displayed on my MFD from my Garmin Traffic Avoidance System; nor did I hear any audio alerts. It turns out based on a NOTAM that the DOD was conducting testing in the areawhich there was a low level chance it could create anomalies with flight deck systems and TCAS. I called the number on the NOTAM and spoke to a gentleman to report my loss of GPS Signal and my loss of targets on my Traffic Avoidance System. I asked if this would have been caused by their testing and he replied yes.In conclusion; I was mentally prepared for a GPS approach but given a different approach. The new approach required a steep turn to the localizer which created some drift. This was exacerbated when the avionics shut down which I rely upon for my situation awareness. In this short period of time of fixating on the avionics; I should have paid more attention to NAV 2 localizer and just fly the plane. I favor flying the WAAS/GPS approach; they are more accurate than the ILS. All the approaches I have flown in the last year have been GPS/WAAS approaches. My autopilot has GPS steering and it couples more accurately to the GPS approach then the localizer approach. Lessons learned; I do not routinely practice ILS approaches. I fly LPV approaches which look and feel the same as an ILS. As such; on approaches for a GPS approach; I need to not only tune in a back up approach; but I need to be prepared to fly the backup approach; including having the approach plate up and available. I need to add ILS/Localizer approaches into my practice currency. Most important of all; I should have considered going missed when my avionics went out and need to add that to my currency practice.

606,606,606,606,2246,Just prior to the final approach fix; I was unable to descend early enough to capture the glide slope from above. We were in IMC and the aircraft was fully configured for landing while descending through 3000 feet MSL at about 1700 FPM at the FAF. We were 400 feet too high as we needed to be at 2;600 MSL to be on the glide slope at that point so I decided to execute a go-around maneuver.Tower also saw that we were high and asked if we were going to be able to make it work. Our reply was that the First Officer (FO) notified ATC of our intention to go-around.We were instructed to climb and maintain 3;000 and turn left heading 270; however; since I had hit the Take-Off Go Around buttons and we were already around 3;000 feet and beginning to climb toward the command bars; I gained 500 feet over the course of the maneuver before adjusting our altitude back down to 3000 feet.ATC quickly asked us if we needed any assistance because of our altitude deviation and slow heading change so the FO replied that we were aware of the deviation and were correcting back to 3;000 while turning to heading 270. We continued the second approach and landed the aircraft safely.As Captain and pilot flying I needed to be more aware of my altitude in relation to the glide slope prior to the final approach fix.

However; after we checked to see if our navigation mode [was] on [and] we noticed that even though navigation mode and auto pilot was on we [had] drifted left of the course. We also checked for any EFIS COMP MON messages. There was no message. As I was about [to] ask for vectors; ATC gave us heading of 230. Then he told us to have our equipment checked for malfunction and we were off course. I replied that we will do that and thanked him. ATC gave us a Center frequency. I contacted the Center. Center instructed us to go direct RBBIT. He also asked us if we need vectors or we are okay to fly RNAV. In that time we were flying towards RBBIT and navigation was performing normal. We replied that we are working with our equipment and seems to be okay now.Today's lesson taught me about situational awareness. Instead of being too automation dependent; I must be aware of [my] position and ready to take corrective action promptly. From now on not only will I brief the departure; I will also highlight the heading and course between the fixes in the SID. And [if] any event equipment malfunction [is] suspected; immediately ask ATC for vectors.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
613,613,613,613,1426,Aircraft X was in route and called ZMP to request to return to RDR. The Controller cleared them back to RDR and I assumed the sector. About 15 minutes later I noticed Aircraft X off course and headed south. I questioned the aircraft and asked if they needed assistance and the reply from the pilot was 'Correcting'. I informed my Supervisor and was told to inform the pilot off a possible pilot deviation and instructed them to call ZMP Operating Manager in Charge (OMIC). This event happened again a few minutes later with the Controller to the north of me. The [UAV] aircraft have difficulty holding altitudes and headings.

615,615,615,615,477,An instrument-rated Private Pilot and I decided to conduct a training flight in actual instrument conditions. The student had planned and filed a roundtrip IFR flight plan. Weather in the area was reported and forecast to be 800-1;000 feet overcast with visibility 2-6 miles. We planned to do an ILS approach at [another airport] followed by a missed approach. The return was planned to be with a simulated vacuum system failure; partial-panel; VOR-DME approach; circle-to-land. As we taxied to the run-up area; we performed the standard instrument checks for the attitude indicator; heading indicator; turn coordinator; compass; etc. We noted a 20-25 degree precession on the heading indicator which is more than it had been during previous flights; but we didn't think too much about it at that time. The vacuum suction gauge did read a little on the low side of the green range during the run-up; but that indication was consistent with 3-4 previous flights in this airplane and neither the student; nor I; nor any other previous pilot had noticed or reported any anomalies with the instruments during flights in the previous several weeks. Additionally; the airplane was equipped with two vacuum pumps and there were no warnings on the annunciator panel. The vacuum system had been inspected by the maintenance shop the previous day and no discrepancies were noted.Shortly after departure; as we entered IMC; we started experiencing occasional moderate turbulence. We proceeded to fly the ILS approach without incident and executed the climbout instructions as per ATC. TRACON cleared us to proceed direct to the fix from which to begin the VOR-DME approach. My student set up the instruments for the approach and turned the airplane towards the fix using GPS navigation. Over the next 5-10 minutes; my student seemed to be having difficulty maintaining accurate control of the aircraft and we drifted significantly off course. I assumed this was because of the strong crosswind and moderate turbulence we had been experiencing. As we turned back to the course; TRACON queried us and I responded that we were correcting. Several minutes later; I noticed that we were significantly deviating again. Now I suggested he use the autopilot in heading mode to reduce his workload until he could get established back on course and get his mind caught up with what was going on. When he engaged the autopilot; it seemed to me that something was not quite right. We had commanded a turn; but I didn't feel anything in the seat of my pants. Not wanting to trust my kinesthetic senses; I scanned the instruments. It seemed that we were turning; albeit at a slow rate. I attributed that to the turbulence; but I was growing suspicious; thinking about the excessive DG precession during our taxi prior to departure. After a few minutes; we had not corrected back to course and we were tracking about 40-50 degrees off. I took control of the aircraft and initiated a turn back towards course. I watched the AI carefully as I applied inputs to turn right. The AI indicated no turn; or perhaps only a very shallow bank. I scanned the turn coordinator and it did show a standard rate turn. I rolled level using the turn coordinator as my reference; but the AI did not show much movement. TRACON queried us again about our position and course and I declared an emergency; stating that we had an inoperative vacuum system. We requested and were given vectors to the ILS approach at our destination. The return flight was difficult; but once we stopped looking at the AI; we felt more confident with control of the aircraft. Though we used the compass as our primary heading reference; the GPS track information was very useful; especially once inside the marker on the ILS approach. My student called out the GPS track every 2-3 seconds while I hand flew that portion. I believe this cooperation was a key to us being able to break out of IMC in a reasonable position to make a landing. In retrospect; I'mnot sure if we could reasonably have done anything to prevent this emergency from happening. Though we had some indication prior to departure that the vacuum system was a little off from previous flights; every piece of supporting information indicated that there were no problems. I do think however; that we should have accepted the no-gyro vectors offered by ATC. I think that due to the workload and stress of the situation; once we had a plan that allowed us better control (use turn coordinator and GPS information); I effectively blocked out any other suggestions that were a significant departure from that plan. Another area where I should have done something different is with how I interacted with the student.... I usually tend to rely singularly on my experience and role as instructor and not usually ask the student for opinions and ideas. However; in this case; the student was an experienced Private Pilot and may have been able to provide more input or at least help me not to get too focused on one course of action. 5-6 days after this emergency flight; the airplane was flown under VFR and no instrument anomalies were noticed. The next day; the maintenance shop discovered a cracked plastic elbow at the vacuum line connection to the attitude indicator. I believe the crack had been there for some time. I think perhaps the moderate turbulence we experienced during our flight may have stressed the elbow such that the crack opened up more. After the airplane sat on the ground for a few days; the elbow probably returned to its normal shape and the crack became small again.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

617,617,617,617,3540,We were assigned the ARKES RNAV SID per our PDC.  The SID was loaded into the FMS and Briefed.  Tower assigned us a heading and cleared us for takeoff.  After takeoff we switched to Departure and checked in with our heading and altitude.  Departure cleared us direct to a fix.  We were unsure of what the Controller said and asked for him to repeat the clearance.  After he responded the Captain and I both looked at out SID chart and determined that we were cleared to HAPOR on the ARKES SID.  HAPOR was the next point on the SID.  After we turned towards HAPOR the Controller told us to turn to 320 and asked if we were heading to ARKES?  We again could not make out what he was saying and asked him to repeat the fix name.  He responded with 'were you not assigned the ARKES SID for departure?'  We replied yes; and knew immediately that he had been saying ARKES all along.  We apologized for our misunderstanding and turned direct to ARKES.  He then cleared us to a higher altitude and switched us to Center.  There was no mention of any problems or traffic conflicts.  We showed no other traffic on our TCAS at the time.After we had completed our climb we discussed our error and determined that it was caused by a combination of the following factors:- We were unfamiliar with the SID and although we briefed the departure we were not familiar with the pronunciation of the fix names.- Communications were garbled and hard to hear at that time.  This was due to our low altitude; high ambient cockpit noise; and weak reception of the Controller.- Expectation bias.  We anticipated flying the SID as published.  As a result; we heard what we were expecting; HAPOR; which was the next point on the SID.- Finally the ARKES fix; as depicted on our chart is in such a position that when both pilots had it clipped to the yoke chart holder; ARKES was covered by the chart clip.

618,618,618,618,4869,Approach was vectoring us to a visual approach to Runway 28L at SFO. We reported the two aircraft in front of us in sight and were told; 'Follow those two heavy aircraft; cleared visual to 28L.' Shortly after receiving that clearance on a 14-mile left base; configured Flaps 5; we encountered about three seconds of wake turbulence. Focusing on my spacing from the two heavies; and not wanting to tuck in behind them too close and encounter more turbulence; I turned off the autopilot and hand flew the aircraft through final to increase our separation. I was unaware that an Airbus was just slightly behind us on a visual to Runway 28R. As I went through final; I heard a TA followed soon after by a 'Descend' RA. I began what I thought was an adequate descent as I turned back to runway centerline; but in about five seconds heard a second 'Descend' RA and then a 'Clear of conflict' shortly thereafter. Just as the first RA went off; ATC gave us a traffic position on the other aircraft. Established back on centerline by eight miles out; we configured for landing and completed a normal approach and landing. If I had announced my intentions to delay my turn to final to the pilot not flying; he might have been more alert to possible conflicts with traffic to 28R and given me a heads up. Rather than allow myself to fly through final; a better option to avoid further wake turbulence would have been to fully configure early and advise Approach of our intentions.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
619,619,619,619,2115,I conducted a visual pattern and approach to runway. I had planned one touch and go followed by a full stop landing. The one minute weather reported the surface winds at 220/6; yielding approximately a 5 knot crosswind component. I conducted a wheel landing and touched down on speed at 70 mph; on centerline; in the touchdown zone; and on the right/upwind wheel. After I lowered the left wheel; the aircraft immediately and uncontrollably veered sharply to the left. I applied full right rudder and immediately held the stick full right and aft to keep the aircraft from ground looping or cartwheeling. I was unable to control the aircraft and we departed the runway to the left and proceeded to impact two of the four PAPI lights. The prop hit a PAPI light causing the engine to quit. The aircraft continued and came to a stop approximately 50 to 100 ft off the runway. There were no injuries to myself (PIC) or passenger. I proceeded to secure the aircraft and survey the scene. I am extremely well trained in tailwheel operations and very familiar with this aircraft as it has been in my family for years. Nothing like this has ever happened. I was alert; well rested; and thoroughly enjoying the beautiful day. I immediately suspected that a brake had locked on the left wheel. This is supported by marks on the runway and grass as well as wear marks on the left wheel.

620,620,620,620,5227,Taking an air carrier with GPS into MMMX- weather lousy; we were a few minutes from diverting in the hold north of SLM.  We knew about the GPS problems after SMO for the ILS 05R- we had the First Officer (pilot flying) set to intercept the SMO 168R outbound; I had the MEX radial setup for the lead turn to the ILS.  We agreed that he would intercept the SMO radial and once tracking; go to heading hold and I would change his radio to the ILS; and he would turn onto the ILS course after my radial was crossed.  The GPS went into DR about 8 DME from SMO; well before the other time I had landed on this runway.  SMO was working well until we crossed the VOR and received a VOR fail.  We went ahead and turned to a 168 heading to allow the VOR to return.  Unknown to me; even though I had stated several times that the GPS was in DR and not reliable; the First Officer decided to use that display and we got off course with the radial turn.

623,623,623,623,1462,After an exhausting morning we arrived [at] JFK for a passenger trip to ZZZ. The FMS would not accept the pre departure clearance so I did the clearance via radio with ATC. We were given the departure. I verified the clearance twice with ATC. The FMS was loaded both crew verified the clearance. After takeoff we were following the FMS for the departure; after CRI we were planning on the right turn to NEION intersection; that's when ATC questions our turn and he immediately assigned us a south bound heading. ATC gave us a telephone number to call after we arrive at ZZZ. We complied after landing at ZZZ. There was no threat to persons or property during this event.  ATC needs to be more specific during the clearance; he should have stated radar vectors after a heading off of CRI. Or there needs to be a waypoint after CRI. The climb and heading of is stated further down the SID but we missed it. (Possible fatigue onset) the heading needs to be more obvious.

624,624,624,624,1698,Close to CTB VOR we encountered severe turbulence at FL350.We had heard reports 'pockets of moderate turbulence 100 east of MLP VOR'.  We were in the clear and smooth air.  Our position was just west of CTB VOR (approximately 140nm east and 70nm north of the reported turbulence). I decided to put the seat belt sign on.  I called the flight attendants and told them to take their jump seats.  The purser answered and said the other two were in the aisle and she would communicate that to them.  I also made a PA that they should take their jump seats.  I am told they immediately began that process of taking the carts toward the back of the aircraft.Before the aft flight attendants could get the carts stowed and in their seats we encountered severe turbulence.  I am guessing the time frame from my communicating to the flight attendants and the turbulence was in the 3-5 minute range.  It began with a mountain wave speed increase that went up to approximately 10 knots above Vmo.  The First Officer (FO) stated he saw .83 Mach; although it may have been higher.  The severe turbulence began almost simultaneously as the airspeed increased.Our altitude went up to an observed 35;700 and down to 34;000 feet before the FO had control of the aircraft.  Bank angles went up to approximately 25 degrees in both directions as the altitude and airspeed varied.  The First Officer was flying as the autopilot disconnected due to high-speed protection mode.  I was attempting to talk to ATC but communication was difficult due to the aircraft movement.  Once I established communication we were cleared continued down to FL310.   I advised ATC of the turbulence and the inability of controlling our altitude.Once we were out of this situation I contacted the flight attendants to see if we had any injuries.  We had one flight attendant injured by the food cart landing on her leg.   No passengers reported any injuries.  I am told the carts rose up under a foot in the turbulence.  The purser was able to just get in her seat as it began.  The turbulence lasted 30 -45 seconds in my estimate (it is only an estimate).The flight attendant injured her leg. It was cut and scraped from the cart.  A nurse was on the flight. She went and checked on her and her partner.  They determined it was ok to continue destination.  They both stated they hit their heads; without any signs of concussion are what I was told.We wrote up the observed airspeed deviation as well as the turbulence encounter.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

As I did that they responded they were having a problem with their autopilot. Very soon after it seemed they were losing control of the aircraft. They descended below the 030 MVA [Minimum Vectoring Altitude] and I issued a Low Altitude Alert. They responded they were a priority aircraft; with a malfunctioning autopilot. I turned on the EOVM [Emergency Obstruction Video Map] and I issued a heading to fly and altitude to maintain when able. I stopped departures at ZZZ1 as they were heading toward the departure corridor. I coordinated with ZZZ for the priority arrival. Aircraft X was able to get the aircraft under control eventually although they never climbed back to the MVA. I continued to issue vectors and eventually cleared them for an ODO [Opposite Direction Operations] arrival that was in line with their route to ZZZ. I was only able to get the minimum information available as the event was extremely time-critical and the pilot was nearly overwhelmed just trying to maintain control of the aircraft.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
627,627,627,627,10693,On taxi out we had to stop to resolve an INS alignment issue. We completed the Before Takeoff checklist. At the line FMC's I pulled up the route page and verified 16R; Cupid 1 to Cupid; transition altitude and magenta line correct. LNAV/VNAV was engaged and we took off. Take off was normal. At approximately 1;000 FT while I was watching airspeed; rate of climb and degree of pitch the flight director commanded a left turn. I momentarily banked the a/c to the left for approximately two seconds when I realized that the departure called for a straight out to the shoreline. I leveled the wings called for heading select and started a turn back to the [runway] centerline. Not fast enough the Tokyo Controller asked why we were deviating to the left. We asked for direct to the first waypoint which the Controller obliged and then had us level off at 7;000 FT for crossing traffic. As far as I know there was no loss of separation laterally and definitely not vertically. After we cleaned up the flaps we tried to figure out why the flight director had commanded a left turn and we found that at some point between the checklist and the takeoff roll the FMC had dumped the departure.

628,628,628,628,10083,At the gate before push back we received the JPOOL7 departure ACT transition. It was entered into both FMS's. Once we taxied out we switched over to ground frequency and we were told to contact clearance so we did. Clearance issued us a new departure NELYN5 ACT transition.I entered it into my side (nonflying pilot) with RWY 18L and double checked all of the points against the NELYN 5 Jeppesen plates. I guess I assumed the FO entered it into his side also or [transferred] it. The first officer is brand new to the Universal FMS and I think he was thinking the info would automatically transfer like it does on the Honeywell FMS.  We are still trying to get used to the fact that the FMS's don't talk to each other.  Once on the RWY 18L I verified that my MFD and FMS was showing the correct departure points. What I failed to do was check my FO's side. Once we departed my first officer noticed that he was still showing the JPOOL7 departure. So we made the decision that I should take the aircraft because I had the correct info on my side but by this point we had drifted to a heading of 200. We confessed our situation to departure he gave us a heading of 190. We reloaded the departure into the First officers FMS and told departure that we could now rejoin and he gave us direct NELYN. The flight continued without incident.  Threats that contributed to this situation are me a captain that has been using the Honeywell FMS for 10 years and trying to get used to the vast differences between the 2 different types of FMS's. A first officer that is brand new to the operation and universal FMS. Also we had been fighting weather and maintenance delays. So we were feeling rushed by this point in the day. The major error that was made was both pilots not checking the new flight plan in both FMS's. I am learning a lot of what to do and not to do because of the Universal FMS; but the major thing I will take away from this incident is to check that not only is my MFD; PFD and FMS showing correct information but that my FO's is also showing the correct info.

Seat belt sign was off as we were in calm clear conditions; typically passing 18;000 ft. arrival PA to pax would be made and seatbelt sign illuminated. There was no traffic in our vicinity depicted on TCAS nor did ATC advise us of any. Suddenly the aircraft began to roll abruptly to the left and right as well as pitching (less abruptly) down.

He asked if they were 'Following anything heavy' to which ATC informed them they were more than 20 miles in trail of a Boeing 777.

632,632,632,632,6457,During departure from SAN on cleared route ZZOOO1.IPL aircraft climbed on heading 275 deg to initial ALT of 520 MSL and continued climb but instead of continuing on course to JETTI waypoint the crew began an early left turn toward ZZOOO waypoint approximately 2.7NM prior to reaching waypoint JETTI while continuing climb to 12000 MSL. Upon reaching the initial altitude of 520 MSL and prior to switching from KSAN tower to SOCAL Departure Control the Co Pilot (CP)/Pilot not Flying (PNF) queried the Pilot in Command (PIC)/Pilot Flying (PF) if we were supposed to begin a turn and the PIC incorrectly assessed that we were required to turn left and changed the Flight Director from NAV to HDG mode (which was preselected for a left turn) rather than continue follow the FMS programed SID in the Flight Director NAV mode. Deviation began approximately 1 minute into flight; error identified by crew with 10-15 seconds upon query by SOCAL approach and initial input for correction made within 15-20 seconds after identification of deviation.Upon notification from SOCAL approach that radar track showed our aircraft deviating from the published SID in an early left turn the PIC/PF; assessed his situational awareness of aircraft location in relation to the published departure was not accurate; reviewed position on FMS Map; determined was in an incorrect early left turn prior to waypoint JETTI and began correction to a right turn towards the published SID course when SOCAL approach cleared to continue turn toward ZZOOO waypoint. PIC/PF selected a DIRECT TO ZZOOO waypoint and continued route.Incorrect interpretation of SID procedure by CP/PNF; failure to maintain adequate situational Awareness by PC/PF at time of incident and incorrect decision of PC/PF upon query by CP/PNF.Contributing Factors:  Perceived 'rushed' environment and reduction in time planned for thorough briefing departure and planned procedures to execute it due to passengers arriving unannounced 30 min prior to scheduled departure.  Assigned crew on this flight had not recently flown as a crew and typically PC would operate as PNF to manage navigation duties during high workload however based on co-pilots high experience level PC made decision to act as PF.PC was overconfident of CP decision/recommendation process.

634,634,634,634,9272,Departing RWY 13 on the LGA Whitestone climb we initiated the turn at 4.1 miles instead of the 2.5 miles as required. ATC informed us of this and we followed instructions to correct error. He was quite correctly agitated at our error. When we were planning for this non-RNAV departure we both correctly briefed the turn headings but somehow managed to read the distance from the Maspeth climb right above the Whitestone box. The Maspeth shares the initial 180 turn. I fly mostly west coast turns and don't get to LGA very often or would have remembered that the turn on the Whitestone is pretty quick. We followed all procedures; had all radios tuned properly; did the route check; but somehow both made the same mistake of reading the distance from the wrong departure. I think we read the 180 heading on the iPad; looked up at the heading select; back down the iPad but 1/4 inch too high and got the distance; then selected the VOR; then back to the iPad for the correct 040 heading.Looking at the iPad it is not totally implausible that the close proximity of the two climbs could lead to this happening. What is hard to fathom is that it would happen to two pilots on the same flight thus not getting caught. Not having been to LGA in a while caused me to very closely check and double check and I still missed it. Unfortunately making the turn at 4.1 put us almost in JFK airspace thus magnifying the error. Given the proximity of the print on the iPad; I plan to make the box big enough that only one climb at a time is visible so that it is not possible to read part of one and part of another.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
635,635,635,635,3579,While conducting the STS VOR DME Runway 14 approach; and while executing the published procedure turn; our ground track crossed over onto the non-protected side; east of the final approach course. The cause for the deviation was the result of an object (an iPad) being placed on the glare shield which caused the magnetic compass to show an erroneous indication; and thus our directional gyro was not correctly referenced. While tracking outbound on the 326 radial; the CDI was centered and we tracked the course properly; however; once we began the procedure turn and turned left to what we believed to be was a heading of 281 as published; we were in fact on a heading closer to 300 degrees. We flew for 1 minute and then turned to the right to join the final approach course. During our turn back to course; the Center Controller advised us that we were east of the final approach course and that we needed to ascend immediately because we were below his MVA for the area we were in. Being that we were in VMC; I immediately canceled our IFR; and we continued VFR into STS to land. After landing we determined that the iPad being placed on the glare shield was the cause for the disturbance to the magnetic compass. As a further note; the iPad was not turned on; in fact the battery was fully discharged. The iPad is getting a lot of praise from the aviation industry; as it is certainly a useful tool for pilots; however; I would recommend that some literature be published to warn pilots of the potential danger it could present in the form of interference with other instruments if not mounted or placed in area known not to cause interference.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Then I requested the pilot to reset the transponder and to say his position and altitude in order to try to locate him. When I finally was able to confirm his position the aircraft was already inside SJUT right in the middle of the departure corridor with Aircraft Y departing out of Runway 8 at TJSJ. The tower controller noticed the situation and was able to stop Aircraft Y below Aircraft X keeping the situation under control.The pilot of Aircraft X was supposed to turn heading 300 on departure and to climb and maintain 1;800.

637,637,637,637,9078,We were cleared to intercept the final approach localizer to Runway 30L into STL. We were about 6 miles from the runway set; cleared for the visual; when Tower cancelled our landing clearance; to give way to a formation flight of F-18s. He let them come in first from a right downwind and right base to 30L in front of us. Tower asked if we would instead land on Runway 29. Because it was so late in the approach; we told tower 'Can't comply'. Tower then asked if we would make a 90 degree right turn; to start an S-turn; to give way to the F-18s. We did; then tower asked us to maintain visual with the F-18s; and cleared us to land behind them. We performed the S-turns; while trying to maintain visual separation with the fighters; but in doing so; we got disoriented; and ended up lining ourselves up with Runway 30R instead. In addition; Runway 30R; although it was closed; did not have an 'X' on it; which added to the confusion. Tower saw that we were on short final for Runway 30R and told us to execute a go around; which we did. We then came back around; and had departure vector us to the ILS Runway 30L.

640,640,640,640,4721,I was the R-side at Sector 38 during this event. Weather had been impacting Area 6 for the majority of the night; with a solid line from the LNK area up to the FOD area in Area 5. There was a hole that aircraft routed over OVR and LNK points west that aircraft had been deviating through; with some deviating all the way north into Area 5's airspace and then points west. The weather closed in and caused all west bound aircraft to deviate north of Area 6 into Area 5.Shortly after a few of my aircraft entered Sector 30; I was told by the Area 5 supervisor at the time that Sector 30 was overloaded and to try and keep aircraft in my area as long as possible. I had to delay giving aircraft deviations in order to keep them out of 30 as long as I could; and even had to hold 2 aircraft at their present position. Multiple other aircraft were given vectors or were descending several thousand feet to avoid conflicts with other aircraft. Then Area 5 came up with a plan to route all aircraft coming from sector 38 and 43 up over MCW direct FSD and points west. For many aircraft MCW was backtracking and turning them wrong for direction. This was happening near the boundary with 38/30 because information was not passed as to what they wanted from us fast enough. I called for a D-side early on in the stint and it was 100% necessary. Not only was the whole situation very unsafe; it was un-efficient as well. It seemed like TMU wasn't giving us any help with sending re routes out to Chicago and Kansas; so sector 38 and 43 had to re route every single aircraft we talked to during that 1-2 hour period. A plan should have been developed for the weather in case it did close in; which ended up happening; to route all OVR and LNK west bound traffic to the north around the weather. This would have at least pinned them all down to a route instead of having every aircraft asking for deviations at the last minute. Also; I felt unsafe working this stint not only because of deviations; but because we haven't been allowed to work an even remotely busy sector for the last year plus during normal operations. But when events like this happen there is no choice but to work it; so we should be able to work busier stints on a daily basis to prepare for the worst case scenarios as described above.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
641,641,641,641,3740,I was the flying pilot and on the runway heading during climbout when I observed; very momentarily out the Captain's window; a very faint 'smear' of vertical lights north of our position. At the moment; I attributed the sighting to a light reflection or distortion effect and gave it no further thought as I was flying and calling out reconfiguring of the aircraft (I made no note of this to the crew as we were in sterile cockpit conditions and it seemed very anecdotal). We started towards the next fix on the SID when we were given a clearance of direct. When we rolled out on this heading; I looked ahead and noted that the lights that I sighted earlier were still present and at our 12 o'clock and we appeared to be on a collision course. The Captain and the IRO were not immediately able to sight the object. I told the Captain that I was deviating to the left of course to avoid the lights. About 3-5 seconds later we passed; abeam what we determined was a lighted; large balloon at our altitude (10;000 feet). I saw as we passed a very faint; indistinct light that had a string of illuminated lights running down what may have been one of the ropes attaching the gondola/instrument package to the gasbag. My best guess is we missed the object between 1/2 to perhaps 1 mile at most. ATC was not aware of the threat and seemed confused upon the Captain's report of the incident. The object did not show on TCAS and so presumably was not transponder equipped. We reported the incident to dispatch; there were no further issues during the flight.

The aircraft is about to turn; and it's going to turn inside the Embraer contrary to the Controller's direction. It seems to me if he wants us to do something different than the SID because of a traffic conflict; he needs to assign us a heading and/or altitude and officially relieve us from the Climb Via clearance. We decided to stay on SID based on our official clearance. I contacted Departure and stated; '4300 climbing via the SHEAD 1.' Meanwhile; I had the Embraer in sight and our courses were converging.

The FMS failed to navigate in NAV mode; while still showing FMS in the flight mode annunciator; due to the numerous runway changes issued by Charlotte approach.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
647,647,647,647,1708,The event started after center changed our arrival into CLE from the TRYBE3 to the ROLLN2. We did not have any issues loading and joining the new arrival. During our descent; there was frequent changes in ATC instructions; including headings off of the arrival; rejoining of the arrival; descend via the arrival; as well as being told to stop our descent earlier than originally planned. Eventually; we were left on a heading off of the arrival; when it sounded like a new Air Traffic Controller took over. At this point ATC cleared us for the approach; despite us still on a heading from the ILS course for 6L. When we asked for clarification the Controller seemed surprised that we were not on an arrival and told us to hold our heading. The Controller then cleared us direct to DEVYL; which the First Officer read back and the Controller did not correct. After flying towards DEVYL; the Controller told us to cross BETLL and cleared us for the approach. We again asked for clarification and he told us that he initially cleared us direct BETLL; not DEVYL; despite the lack of correction. At this point; approach told us to descend to 2;600 feet and report the field in sight; even though we were still in IMC. We told approach that we did not have the field and we were given a climb and vector to rejoin the ILS. The flight continued to a landing without any further issues.The cause of this event is due to the lack of correction on read back; combined with fixes that could be pronounced in different ways. The crew misheard the Controller and I assume that the Controller also misheard our read back due to the lack of correction.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
648,648,648,648,2379,We were assigned the TRISS 1 RNAV departure as the first part of the our clearance. During preflight; I had noted that all the SID fixes depicted on the chart agreed with what was in the FMS and that PRCHDG displayed on the PFD. I had also noted that Q values were good. During taxi; it was re-verified that the departure page showed the correct runway and first fix and everything looked correct on the MFD. After takeoff; I called for NAV to be selected and began following the course indication on my PFD. Almost immediately I noticed that it seemed like the turn toward NAVIE started early; but the urge to follow course guidance is pervasive; so I followed. Pretty quickly; the First Officer asked where I was going. I immediately glanced at his PFD and saw it indicated I was off course to the left. I quickly determined; partly by my location visually; that his PFD was giving the correct course guidance and I turned toward it and selected cross side data of his NAV on my PFD. I can't say if we were still on Tower frequency when this error was discovered or if we had already gone to Departure; but nobody from ATC ever said anything to us about being off course. Perhaps we were not off course enough for them to mention it. I did happen to notice that the off course distance stated on the First Officer's MFD when I first looked at it showed .60 of a mile. Perhaps ATC felt it was not enough to mention as we were off course to the east and therefore away from the opposite side departure corridor. Perhaps nobody at ATC noticed. Perhaps the error was noted and something will be said later. In any case we returned to the correct course as quickly as possible. It would appear that this event happened because; although I thought I had done a complete preflight of the FMS; in retrospect I found I had missed one thing. Of course we wanted to know why we were getting bad data from the #1 FMS and we began to check everything out. Quickly; it was observed that on the NAV 2/2 page; while the Q still showed okay at Q=4; the NAV mode was not GPS; it was DME. I had failed to observe this when I checked the Q during the preflight. I am now pretty sure that it must have been this way during the preflight as when I went to DATA 2/4 I found that both GPS inputs had been deselected. I have no idea who might have done this or when it might have been done; but after I reselected the GPS inputs they stayed selected for the rest of the time I had the aircraft and GPS data stayed accurate and/or agreed with the other side's data. The only other thing I am not sure about is while this seemed to be the problem and the unit appeared to give very accurate data after this problem was corrected; according to AOM volume 1 PRE-FLIGHT; I should have gotten good guidance even with one FMS in DME mode. It says; 'If one FMS does not indicate 'GPS;' it will automatically use the GPS signal from the other FMS and either FMS can be used to fly the RNAV SID.' This does not appear to have been correct in this case. My solution for avoiding a recurrence of this event is to make sure I notice the NAV mode and not just the Q value during my preflight preparation.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
649,649,649,649,8856,While descending on the JAGGR3 RNAV arrival into Denver; all was well with planned RNAV RNP 17R loaded in the FMC. We had been cleared to descend via the JAGGR3 and had a discontinuity between QWIKE on the arrival and QWIKE on the approach as we had never yet been cleared for the approach. Somewhere around JAAAM (I believe) Approach Control told us to slow early to 210 KTS. This put us a bit high on profile and we were having to react aggressively to make the 11000 at QWIKE. About the same time we were cleared for the RNAV RNP Z 17R approach. I selected QWIKE for the approach (below the discontinuity) and attempted to place it just below QWIKE on the arrival (above the discontinuity) but it would not take. I am not sure if there was an accompanying scratch pad message but I then selected QWIKE below the discontinuity and placed it on top of QWIKE above the discontinuity and got an execute light. Confirmed with the First Officer (F/O) and pushed execute. Still not sure exactly what went wrong but the jet did not start the turn at STAAM but instead went straight ahead. After a slight delay to see that the autopilot was not going to make the turn; I disconnected the autopilot and hand flew the airplane for the remainder of the approach as it was clear skies and near unlimited visibility with the runway in sight. Just after I disconnected the autopilot and was beginning the turn; ATC asked if we were flying the RNAV Z 17 R and the F/O replied 'yes'. No more was said and we continued to landing. I have little doubt that some mistake was made and the FMC was misprogrammed in the rushed environment that was created by ATC but am not sure what it was. I did realize after starting the turn that there was a magenta line that also continued straight ahead in addition to the curved magenta line of the approach but it was not readily noticed in the hurried state we had been suddenly put in. I will investigate further when back in an airplane and with ample time to do so. I would like to stress that I can't really think of a time while descending on a descend via arrival into Denver that Approach Control did not change things up from published at least once; and many times there are multiple changes. This happens all the time in Denver and from talking to other pilots it is common to everyone. I can understand the occasional need to change a speed or altitude but this seems to happen every single time on arrivals into Denver. I feel it has become a safety hazard and it is not just me. Many pilots feel the same. These arrival changes are often combined with late approach clearances just like happened in this case. Why can't Denver just clear us to descend via an arrival and cleared for the RNAV XXX approach like many other cities do in what seems like far more congested airspace?,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
650,650,650,650,4570,Our clearance was to depart the HRMNS 2 RNAV Departure off of 10L. I was the pilot flying. We had completed our preflight duties and the Captain called for the Before Start Checklist. After the Captain completed his briefing; I began with the departure briefing reading off each fix and crossing restrictions from the chart. During that time; the Agent dropped off the load sheet and began to thank the Captain for helping with wheelchairs. When calling for push; Ground said to expect Runway 10L at Tango. I got the new numbers after push and we then completed the Before Taxi Checklist. Once airborne; LNAV disengaged so I called for LNAV at 400 FT and the aircraft started directing a right turn toward PEGTY; the first fix off of the 28's. I noticed shortly after that that we did not have the correct points in front of us. I realized that the FMC had the waypoints for the 28's programmed instead of the 10's. The Captain tired to input the next waypoints; but we had already passed each of the fixes he entered. Tower asked us where we were going and that we did not follow the appropriate course. He asked us to contact Departure and we were then given direct HRMNS. I do believe I checked the route and LEGS page before push; because I normally do. While I was reading the departure briefing; we were distracted by the Agent. The Captain may have missed crosschecking the points with the FMC.

Shortly after passing WENTZ we were sent direct ELVAE and cleared to climb to 6000. After ELVAE we proceeded direct to WHITE. Although we were filed to COL it was not in the issued clearance. Shortly after departing ELVAE ATC queried us as to our heading and asked if we were proceeding to COL. We told him no that we understood COL was taken out of our clearance and we were going to WHITE. He wanted us to go to CPL and that is what they wanted us to fly off of the SID. We then proceeded as directed.  Looking at the SID again it says to expect vectors ELVAE/COL/WHITE. We understood that to mean we would be vectored to one of those fixes then proceed on filed course after that.  The SID is worded different than most SIDs in the route description with a '/' [FORWARD SLASH]' instead of the word 'thence' or 'direct' [separating the fixes].

652,652,652,652,5747,I took over the position after the previous controller had cleared the aircraft for an ILS Approach. Shortly thereafter; I noticed that the aircraft was drifting left of course. I asked the pilot if he was correcting. He replied something unintelligible and 'ILS'. I watched him for a few more seconds at which point he seemed to start zigzagging across the localizer. I asked him if he was okay; and I believe I received no reply. I then told the pilot to climb and maintain 3;000 feet and fly heading 360. I don't believe he replied to that either. After a few more seconds; it became obvious to me that the pilot had vertigo and was spiraling the aircraft in a left turn. I told the pilot that he probably doesn't realize it; but he was in a tight left turn and he needed to level his wings. During this whole process; I believe he transmitted a few times; but usually it was what sounded like a grunting noise. Shortly after the tight turns; he lost control of his altitude; and began climbing rapidly upwards a few thousand feet; and then stalled out and plunged back to within a few hundred feet of the ground; repeatedly.During the entire time I continued to encourage him to level his wings and try to level out his altitude; and fly any heading of his choosing. The controllers around me assisted in trying to locate a nearby VFR airport (there were none); and controlling airplanes that normally would have been controlled on my frequency. After about 10 minutes of terror; he finally gained control of the aircraft and flew on a 190 heading at 3;000 feet. I left him flying that course and altitude for several miles to try to clear his vertigo. During this time; he requested the RNAV approach. To keep him from getting vertigo again; I turned him no more than 90 degrees at a time and did not change his altitude; and then left him on the new heading for a minute or two before turning additional degrees to get him setup for the RNAV approach. Once he was nearly straight-in with the runway; I cleared him for the RNAV approach and he landed without further incident.After speaking to people familiar with the [aircraft]; it seems apparent to me that this pilot was not only unprepared for the weather he was flying in; but also unfamiliar with all of the systems of his aircraft. Apparently; he could have just pressed a button and the aircraft would have leveled off on it's own. Although it is probably beyond the scope of the FAA; but my recommendation would be that [aircraft's] pilots receive more training on the proper handling of their aircraft in IMC conditions.For controllers; perhaps more information on what we can or should suggest to pilots who encounter this type of situation. As a flight instructor; I had some ideas of what to say to him; but I don't know if all other controllers would know this. Also; it was suggested to me to tell the pilot to pull his parachute. I do not know the legality of saying that to the pilot would be; especially if it resulted in a worse outcome. On the other hand; if he had crashed the aircraft; would the FAA had preferred that I suggest pulling the parachute?

653,653,653,653,9673,I departed UAO airport on the clearance I was given by UAO ground. I read back my clearance and ground control confirmed my clearance was accurate. The clearance was cleared to ZZZ airport UBG VOR then flight plan route; maintain 4;000 feet expect 6;000 feet five minutes after departure. The published departure procedure calls for at or above 700 feet direct UBG. I was instructed to taxi to runway 35. I taxied to the hold line for runway 35 and switched to tower frequency. I had to wait quite a while to call the tower as the frequency was quite congested. Tower was working an airplane with a mechanical issue to be number one to land. I called the tower and advised the controller I was ready for my IFR departure clearance as he was very busy with sequencing landing traffic. I was then cleared for takeoff without any further instructions or amendments. I read back the takeoff clearance verbatim. After established in the climb; I was told to contact Portland Departure. The departure frequency was very busy as I climbed through 1200 feet. I started my turn direct to UBG VOR.The controller then queried me as to what my clearance was to depart UAO airport. I told him it was the same as I had filed; UBG then flight planned route. He told me to turn to heading 020 and maintain 3;000 feet with which I complied. After about three minutes the controller called me back and advised me to call Portland ATC on the land line. He gave me a number to call; for a possible deviation. After reaching my destination I called the number. The controller I spoke with advised me UAO tower controller stated he had cleared me to fly runway heading after takeoff. Had I heard that I would have most certainly complied. I honestly feel that was never said to me. The controller then told me the sector controller was very busy at the time with traffic. He thought this is why he did not get to your initial call sooner. He told me there was no loss of separation with traffic and they have had five or six other aircraft departing UAO on runway 35 that have done the same thing in the past few months. The controller told me UAO had recently got a contract tower and his office will be gathering information to come up with a resolution to make this departure safer for both pilots and controllers.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
654,654,654,654,1875,On an IFR flight plan into the Los Angeles area; I was given the Kayoh Four arrival and then given a reroute as follows: direct PDZ then heading 270 to intercept V394 to SLI; and then direct. While putting the new route into the GPS; Approach asked if I could expedite descent to cross 6 east of PDZ at 6;000; which required a 1;500 FPM rate of descent. I accepted the request and complied; but the abnormal descent rate took time away from setting the reroute in the GPS. I asked my pilot rated wife in the right seat to look at the chart and find V394 for me. She did and showed me the airway label on the current (62nd edition) VFR Los Angeles TAC chart. It shows V394 as the 058 degree radial from Seal Beach VOR. I set that in the #2 VOR and continued on. I crossed PDZ at 4;000 MSL and turned to 270 heading. The Controller questioned what I was doing and I read back to him the clearance stated above and he gave me a further turn to 290 degrees. At this point I was confused by the heading away from Torrance and away from what I thought was V394. I don't recall all the discussion on the frequency; but it was not a smooth operation. I asked about SLI 058 radial and he said V394 was the POM 187 degree radial. Confusion and consternation ensued. Upon studying the chart later; I see that there is an error in the 62nd edition VFR Los Angeles TAC chart. It has the label V394 on the airway just east of AHEIM Intersection. But V394 turns sharply north at AHEIM; to Pomona VOR. The misplaced label made me think that there was no turn in V394 and that it was defined by the 058 radial to PDZ. In other words; there are two airways labeled V394 on this chart and I picked the wrong one in the eyes of SCT Approach. The issue arose from the last minute reroute and abnormal descent request; coupled with a labeling error on the chart. If I had had time to look for V394 myself; I would have seen the proper info on the IFR chart. Since I was pressed for time and asked my VFR rated wife to help; she picked up the bad info from the VFR chart. Looking back; I should have refused either the reroute or the high rate descent or both. It was too many changes in too little time to accomplish smoothly.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
655,655,655,655,3616,We were inside 40 miles to the airport on a STAR arrival descending through the mid teens when we noted the right hydraulic light illuminated. I am not sure if it had just illuminated or it had been on. In certain jets the master caution does not illuminate with this light. We ran the R HYD PRESS LOW LIGHT Checklist. After we turned the right engine pump; auxiliary pump and transfer pump off the quantity returned to normal. [We were] less than 30 miles out. Following through the checklist: If right hydraulic quality is normal and associated light is illuminated: Engine pump on; system check. If right hydraulic system pressure normal: No further crew action required. END. [We were] 15 miles out cleared to intercept localizer and cleared for the approach.The checklist ends there and implies it was an indication problem; I didn't think so. While keeping an eye on the quantity gauge; working the system in my head; and working out a contingency plan if we suddenly lose right pressure; I checked the runway in the box and hit NAV. I looked at the checklist one last time to see if we missed anything or our situation changed where to go next on the page. This is when I saw the localizer swing through. I quickly selected HDG SEL and turned back to the localizer. A moment or two later; Final Monitor gave us a heading to reestablish localizer. I was already there. We landed normally; reversers deployed; spoilers deployed; brakes were normal as was the steering; the right hydraulic quantity read 1 quart and pressure normal. [We] taxied in without problem.I had noted earlier in the flight that the APU ram door was stuck open so if we actually did lose fluid it just all went into the APU. We did not attempt to start it. At the gate Maintenance confirmed we had lost the majority of the right system; and the APU was full of fluid.I then called TRACON to apologize for the overshoot and to see if there were any conflicts. They told me there were no issues with the approach.From the discovery of the low quantity light to landing was about 12 minutes. In addition to trying to work through a new and completely different QRH procedure; and other normal approach checklist and duties; time was definitely a factor in my response to this situation. I believe if this problem occurred 100 miles out I would have handled it completely different. In hind sight I think pulling myself out of the arrival; declaring an emergency; and covering all the bases would have been the correct thing to do. As I said before; by just running the QRH procedure leaves you with: If right hydraulic pressure normal: No further crew action required. END. If I had a few minutes to think about it I would have known this was an error. After a couple of days I am still mad at myself for letting the ball play me instead of me playing the ball! In declaring an emergency; it would have given me time; technical assistance and all the airspace I wanted. Lesson learned.Lastly; I have; before this event; spent a considerable amount of time reviewing the new QRH. I believe this is the fourth or fifth iteration of this manual I have been issued.

I told him the correct heading to fly and he initially re-intercepted the course and started to descend on the approach. He then seemed to lose situational awareness of where he was on the approach and started to deviate both laterally and vertically from the published procedure. I commanded a go-around which he did initiate. The Tower noted the deviation and I told them that we were 'going around.' We were then vectored back for another approach which was flown successfully and the landing was normal. The weather at the time was reported at 800 broken and six miles; but was in fact at minimums for the LOC/DME BC [RWY] 35L Approach.The problems were as follows: 1. the weather was much lower than reported. I let him continue to fly the approach longer than I should have; thinking we would pick up the runway visually. 2. His unfamiliarity with LOC/BC Approaches. 3. Dispatching [older aircraft] to airports where the only option is a non-precision approach in marginal weather conditions. 4.

657,657,657,657,2455,We had been doing the ILS to 12L in MSP and the Runway Condition Codes (RCC) had been reported at 5/5/5. We had a fairly strong crosswind approximately 20 knots and the aircraft ahead of us reported medium to poor braking. The Captain had briefed before that he would touch down a bit more firm than usual and get onto the brakes fairly quickly to ensure we would stop in time. I think the Captain touched down a bit softer than he would have liked and when he tried to deploy the thrust reversers only the left side deployed. The effect was almost immediate as I could feel the plane begin to slide to the left side of the runway. By the time the right reverser had deployed the plane was completely unresponsive to the Captain's control inputs and we slid nearly sideways down the runway. We were able to regain control probably less than 10 feet from the runway edge and exit the runway and taxi to the gate without further incident. We reported to ATC that braking was poor to nil and they sent the following airplanes around and closed the runway for treatment.So far my experience with RCC values has proven them to not be sufficient in evaluating actual runway conditions. More than a year after the implementation I have yet to see an RCC value below 5 on a runway I've used in varying conditions. The reported values during the time of our landing were not an accurate representation of the actual runway conditions.The CRJ-200 has a tendency of asymmetric thrust reverser deployment which exacerbated the situation. Additionally; I think the idle thrust reverse landing program (even though its use was never considered in this situation) has led to a lot of confusion about when to apply and has led to slow deployment among other crews I have seen from the flight deck jumpstart. The RCC values need to be updated more frequently and need to error on the side of caution. We had departed earlier in similar conditions without incident and the RCC values were the same despite drastically different runway conditions. Something needs to be done about the asymmetric reverser deployment. In flight; the thrust lever split was so large that two fingers could fit between the thrust levers. It's possible that this split made the aircraft not think the right thrust lever was actually idle and prevented the reverser from deploying. Regardless of the situation crews should utilize thrust reverses in the event runways are not the same they have been reported.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

We both agreed that on course and not direct was the clearance. After a minute or so the Departure Controller asked if we were direct CTF. I stated no we were joining the on course route.

The Captain had been changing some of the INIT Data because ATC had changed our final cruising altitude. However; we are both unaware of how that could have resulted in a hold being entered; since it is fairly difficult to enter a hold without knowing it. We were approximately 45 degrees off our course when I switched to heading mode and start to turn back toward our course. The Captain advised ATC of an issue with our autopilot and we were given a heading of 180. After getting the FMS out of the hold; we asked for direct and were given heading 190; direct when able. No further incidents occurred during the flight.Threats were a change in final cruising altitude that resulted in a change in the INIT data. There were no errors that we were aware of. The undesired aircraft state was the course deviation of 45 degrees.

We joined the localizer and got a TA and noticed another RJ (Regional Jet) headed around 150 degrees to join the localizer for [Runway] XXL; which wasn't going to be a factor. We were never left of the [Runway] XXR localizer at any point. We caught the glide slope and headed down while configuring.

Captain was flying; he disconnected the AP (Autopilot) and flew the breakout procedure. I told ZZZ Tower we had a RA and he was swamped today so he initially wanted us to go around; to which I said we had flown the breakout and were established on the approach - going around and flying his instructions would've led to a second RA since we were instructed to climb right into that jet that just flew over the top of us.

661,661,661,661,4642,The event was the whole session. This was my second session on this sector and the first one was also extremely busy. The sector had weather all over it and TMU (Traffic Management Unit) knew about it earlier in the day. The previous session we made sure to tell the Supervisor that the DCA; BWI and IAD arrivals were all deviating. We needed a lot of in trail because we had no room to space. When I took over for this session; it was worse and we were holding for DCA for VIP movement at the airport. We had weather at our usual holding place so we had to hold at AIR; which is one of the busiest areas of our sector. From there it went downhill. My URET (User Request Evaluation Tool) was full and I could tell that the list went down past what was showing. I told the Supervisor that something needed to be done because I was already busy with deviations and I have nowhere for anyone to go. I did not have the space to go red. I had multiple aircraft that needed to land that were high and I couldn't get down; because of weather deviations and other sectors.I had one aircraft I had at FL340 that wanted to deviate. I cleared him without pinning him down to a certain number of degrees and he turned more than I thought. I descended him to FL330 and asked him to expedite and report reaching. I also called traffic. I turned the other aircraft but it was so busy I had no idea if he was there or if he answered the turn. The CA (Captain) never said he was closer than five miles but I was not sure and the situation of the sector for the whole session was unsafe and I feel we had no help whatsoever from anyone around us; TMU; ZID; ZDC. This was one of the most unsafe situations I have been a part of in my career and I am angry that we were put in this situation to be scared for the safety of the airplanes. This was ridiculous and unsafe. We had the most weather in the whole center and I was confused as to why airplanes were all coming through our sector. I feel that there was no planning and no help from TMU. When I finally went on break (I mentally needed one well before I was offered one because we were one under the number) I walked past TMU and they were all laughing and laid back not looking remotely busy. I had no time to call weather and the pilots did not get any kind of heads up on the weather because of how busy it was and the congestion on the frequency. I feel this was a fail on management and TMU!As a controller and the one actually having to work the traffic and be scared about the safety of the aircraft; I do not appreciate being put in this situation; it could have been prevented. Aircraft should have been rerouted before our sector. I would not have wanted to be on an airplane in that and I would not want any of my family on it either. It is not often I have felt that way about the product we put out. I recommend that the new New York situation of not being able to put in trail or pretty much ask for anything not come before the safety of aircraft. If there is weather; there needs to be in trail for safety; I recommend more staffing. We may not need as many people during the winter but summer our staffing is not acceptable. Six day work weeks are not a good situation for the mental strength of the employees. I recommend that we staff to the number; we were one under and we really needed more people. I need TMU to help us rather than saying yes to everything that other centers ask for. I can't tell you how many times we have a push for DCA; IAD; BWI and the weather is literally covering the whole border of us and Blue Ridge. So then we have departures and arrivals head on.

This was followed by a resolution advisory (RA) directing us to descend.

ATC was apprised about the deviation from the SID as we descended towards the ocean; making a left turn while accelerating. ATC advised that they showed no other aircraft in our vicinity.

663,663,663,663,10089,We were cleared the visual approach Runway 35; track the localizer in to ZZZZZ. It is an offset localizer. The ZZZZZ fix is not in the FMS. It is about 2 NM from the end of the runway at approximately 700 feet. At 1300 feet AGL the 'track the localizer to ZZZZZ' dropped out of my brain and I prioritized to the Stabilized Approach criteria. I told the First Officer to start moving to the center line of the runway so we could be lined up by 1000 feet. As we did so; Tower told us to come back right to get back on the localizer. He asked us if we could see the traffic to our left for Runway 34R. I could not see the traffic. In the later phone call with the Approach controller; he said it was an RJ that was behind us and that they were keeping us in sight. After a few moments of tracking the localizer; Tower cleared us to go ahead and come left to line up with the runway. We landed without incident. There is a note on the Green page to not do the maneuver we did and that Stabilized Approach criteria could be deviated from because of the offset approach. We did brief from the Missed App/Rejected landing table on page 10-7E but completely missed the paragraphs about the Visual Approach to 35 on 10-7C. While there are contributing factors to this deviation; the bottom line is that had we been more thorough in our reading and briefing of the Green pages; this event never would have happened. A large contributing factor to this was that; at altitude; we did not brief a visual to Runway 35. I have never flown an approach to Runway 35 and have always thought of it as the runway they use for the RJ's. We were briefed and up to speed for the 34's. Further; kind of late in the arrival; the controller cleared us to a fix to intercept the localizer for 'ILS 35'. We could not find that in our Jepps; so I told her that all we had was the Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA) for 35. She said OK cleared to intercept the localizer for the LDA. And so commenced a rushed briefing followed by the runway change items on the checklist.The best thing that can be done to prevent this from happening again is to have a FMS fix at ZZZZZ. A note on the Flight Plan for ZZZ that give pilots a heads up for Runway 35 might also be appropriate. On a personal note; at Top of Descent I felt completely up to speed. It was a beautiful VFR day and 'I assumed' that of course we would be landing on one of the 34's.

664,664,664,664,8214,We were holding short of RWY 16L on C taxiway. There was a piston aircraft (possibly a Diamond Star) on approach onto 16L but I don't recall hearing any communications between the aircraft and tower as they may have been using the frequency assigned for that particular RWY. After we saw the aircraft pass overhead; tower cleared us to cross 16L and depart 16R. Immediately after take-off; we saw the small aircraft just ahead and slightly above our altitude; and to our left. PF immediately initiated a steep bank turn to the left at about 180 KTS; while leveling at 1700 feet for restriction on Newhall Eight departure. We had the aircraft in sight the entire time and passed behind him. As expected; we also received an RA. In order to avoid possible collision; we had to turn to about a 090 heading as oppose to 110 heading required by the departure. After we switched to SOCAL; we were asked for our heading. At this point we had initiated a turn back to 110. I advised SOCAL of what had happened including the RA. He asked if tower advised us of traffic prior to takeoff and I said 'No' but may have after we took off. SOCAL then told us that he called tower and told them that 'we were not happy' with what had happened and if we wanted to pursue this matter any further at this time. We told them no. We were given further vectors by SOCAL and finally cleared to SLAPP. Tower should have obviously provided separation in this case especially since they operate 2 different frequencies for the parallel RWYs. Crew may listen to the other tower frequency but that may cause confusion at times as well. When holding short of 16L on C; due to the distance between where you are and where the small aircraft are landing; it is hard to tell if it is a full-stop; touch-n-go; fly-over; etc. unless you are actually listening to the communication or inquiring from tower. I think at the present time; the best way to handle this from a crew perspective is to ask tower as to the intentions of the aircraft utilizing 16L; and making sure sufficient spacing exists prior to departure.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

When Aircraft X was leaving FL180; flashing occurred with this aircraft and Aircraft Y level at FL180; an aircraft landing DCA.  Both aircraft were approximately 6 miles apart and closing fast.   The Controller at 25 thought the departing Aircraft X was on a different route and would not be a factor with each other; but he did not read the flight plan correctly before shipping the Aircraft X to me.  I called out to the controller at Radar 25 (who was talking to Aircraft Y) and said I would turn Aircraft X; with whom I was in contact with; left behind the Aircraft Y due to the fact that the Aircraft X was slower and could prevent separation with that turn.  I used a 350 heading which was very drastic; but worked; resulting in no loss of separation with these two aircraft.  It turned out to be a 'bubble rubber.'  When the separation was accomplished; I turned Aircraft X back on course to EMI which is approximately a 260 heading.  Aircraft X was turning slowly.  Before turning back; the Aircraft X began flashing with another aircraft; Aircraft Z; which was climbing out Westward from PHL out of FL190.  After a few hits; loss of separation occurred between these two aircraft; Aircraft X and Aircraft Z.  When the flashing occurred; I had stopped the climb of Aircraft X at FL200 while the Aircraft Z was continuing the climb.  At total separation of 2 hundred feet and 2.81 miles occurred.Radar 25 controller should have read out the flight plan and understood the aircraft he gave to me was on a more westerly route.  I tried to save a deal by turning the aircraft I had; but that turn resulted in another deal with a departing aircraft in Sector 25's airspace.  Better communication between me and the controller at 25 would have resulted in no loss of separation.  If he listened to me and heard that I was going to turn the climbing plane to left behind his aircraft; then he could have warned me about other traffic that he had in his airspace.  As far as myself; I should have quick looked his airspace to see if there was any other traffic for Aircraft X before giving him such a drastic turn.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
667,667,667,667,6874,During descent on the SPRTN3 Star via LAN; my Captain and I noticed a discrepancy between the information our FMS/GPS was showing as well as our HSIs. We were given a vector after SPRTN intersection to intercept the 9R localizer into PTK. When we turned to the assigned heading ATC queried us regarding our present heading and location. At this time we realized there was an apparent malfunction with our navigation systems. We were given a descent below the ceiling and became oriented visually using local landmarks and dead reckoning. While we didn't have any system warnings or flagged (failed) avionics; it was apparent that both of our headings were approximately 90 degrees different than our actual orientation.We were subsequently cleared for a visual approach and landed without any issue as ATC helped us gain situational awareness by providing directional cues to the airport once we were in VMC conditions.After discussing the event with Maintenance we are still waiting to hear back on what the issue was. The aircraft is an older model and it is not overly uncommon to have older components fail simply due to their age.

668,668,668,668,7127,Aircraft X was issued and accepted an approach clearance for the RNAV visual to Runway 26R and was on the RNAV track on the downwind. Aircraft Y was on base leg being vectored to follow Aircraft X. I had vectored Aircraft Y away from the RNAV arc to ensure separation. Aircraft X did not turn on the arc and continued downwind so I instructed Aircraft X to turn right immediately heading 200 and issued traffic. I then reissued a 210 heading and reissued the traffic. The pilot replied and said they were looking. I then issued traffic to Aircraft Y and they reported traffic insight so I instructed them to maintain visual separation. After both aircraft were on final and cleared I asked Aircraft X if they noticed that they had not made the turn on the arc. The pilot responded they did and were making a turn. The Operations Manager told me that the pilot later said that they did not have the waypoints in the FMS but I am not sure how this affects whether or no the aircraft turns when they are supposed to. The first recommendation would be to not have base leg traffic while conducting RNAV visual approaches. Secondly; altitude separation would alleviate the safety concern however the altitude of both aircraft was 6;000 FT and that was the altitude issued to the base leg traffic from the previous position and the downwind traffic did not descend fast enough to ensure altitude separation.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
669,669,669,669,5492,I was on an IFR flight to AVP. The weather was clear. At 4;000 feet; the winds were out of the west at approximately 50 knots and it was an extremely bumpy ride. I was being vectored by Approach for a Visual Approach. The controller had me descend to 4;000 feet and told me that he was going to sequence me in behind an RJ (Regional Jet) who was on a right down wind. I was on a left down wind. The RJ was slightly behind me. I assumed that the RJ would quickly overtake me and the delay would only be a minute or two. Meanwhile; I heard the controller advise another aircraft that a Cessna had reported severe turbulence at 4;000 feet in the same area I was being vectored towards; so my passenger and I both re-cinched our already tight seatbelts. The RJ did not over take me and the controller did not change the sequence. Making matters worse; the controller vectored the RJ on an exceptionally wide pattern and consequently extended my downwind approximately 10 miles north of the airport in order to place me behind the RJ. The turbulence report from the Cessna was correct. It was severe over the mountains in the vicinity of the Airport; which sits in a valley between two ridges. After I complained to ATC that I could have landed and been clear of the runway long before he turned the RJ back to the airport instead of suffering in turbulence; the controller finally turned me onto a base. At that time; the turbulence became so severe that my passenger and I both hit our heads on the ceiling; the autopilot disconnected; the airplane pitched down; and began a steep descending turn. I was able to recover control quickly; but not before the aircraft had lost 600 feet of altitude and turned 30-40 degrees off the assigned course.When I complained about being vectored into the reported severe turbulence; a heated exchange arose between ATC and me. A controller; who I surmise was a supervisor as he was not the same individual who was previously vectoring me; berated me for being off altitude and heading; implying that he intended to report a pilot deviation. I explained that the severe turbulence was the reason for the deviation and that I had recovered as quickly as I could having been knocked around; but the controller was not interested. I became very frustrated as the controller appeared more concerned with the deviation (even though there was no loss of separation with other traffic) than our safety or the reason for the deviation. As the situation was escalating on the radio; I thought it best to terminate the conversation and cancelled IFR. Upon acknowledging my cancellation; the controller made the snide and extraordinarily unprofessional remark that perhaps I should seek medical attention for hitting my head on the ceiling. In retrospect; I should have cancelled IFR much earlier when I was abeam the numbers and realized that I could land right away if I did so without being a factor for the RJ. I also realize that I should have rejected the vectors into the reported severe turbulence; however; I had no idea the vector would be as extended as it turned out to be. On the other hand; I am disappointed that the controllers in this case refused to understand or appreciate that their actions had actually put me and my passenger in significant danger. Granted I was angry about having been placed in a situation where my safety was at risk and probably too vocal on the air; but that is not an excuse for the controller; sitting in a comfortable chair in the radar room; to focus on having the last word in a radio exchange rather than focusing on keeping airplanes out of the known severe turbulence and getting them on the ground as quickly as possible. The lack of professionalism was striking; especially when compared to the exceptional job done by almost every controller; every day.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

679,679,679,679,3167,While cruising at FL410 west of DEN [airport]; the Captain and I were analyzing a severe thunderstorm complex on our route of flight over NE. Our route of flight was DBL-HCT (Hayes Center)-OVR-BDF. I referenced my JeppPro app and suggested a route to the south; via HYS (Hays)-BDF. The Captain verified the routing with the dispatcher who agreed with the plan. The Captain then radioed Denver Center and requested the weather reroute by asking for 'direct Hayes Center direct Bradford'. I saw that on my JeppPro chart the VOR we wanted to fly to was 'Hayes'; but I knew I often heard 'Hayes Center' referred to on the radio so I thought to myself it was a colloquial reference to the same fix. When the Controller asked for us to repeat the request; I reminded the Captain 'Hays' but he repeated 'Hayes Center'; and I didn't speak up more forcefully again thinking it wasn't quite correct but it was colloquial reference to the same fix. I entered HYS into the FMS; verified it with the Captain and executed the turn; approximately 10 degrees right. A few minutes later we were issued a frequency change to a new Denver Center Controller who answered our check-in with; 'it looks like you're on a shortcut.' The Captain explained that we had received a new clearance due to weather from the previous Controller and said that we were 'direct hotel-yankee-sierra direct bravo-delta-foxtrot.' The Controller said something like 'I'll make sure that's updated for you' and that was the end of the discussion. At that point the Captain and I went back and reconstructed why the Controller seemed unaware of our routing and at that point I realized the Hayes vs. Hayes Center confusion - that there are two frequently-used NAVAIDs in close geographic proximity with extremely similar names.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
680,680,680,680,10455,I reached out to Aircraft X who was switched to my new tower frequency. The student pilot acknowledged he was on frequency and I gave him instructions to make a right turn after landing; and to 'change to Runway 30L cleared to land.' The reason for the right turn was to protect for helicopter traffic operating on the taxiway to the left of Runway 30L. I believe the pilot read back my instructions correctly.I turned my scan to check the position of the helicopter and the other fixed wing aircraft in my pattern and began to sequence the fixed wing aircraft to follow Aircraft X. As I issued the position of Aircraft X as being '1/2 mile final;' I realized something was wrong because Aircraft X did not appear in the right position. I suddenly realized he was touching down on Runway 30R and alerted the other controller. The Local 1 controller immediately sent around jet traffic on final for Runway 30R and the pilot made the go around prior to the runway threshold. The instructor in Aircraft X began asking if he was cleared for a touch-and-go; to which I responded that it appeared he landed on Runway 30R; to cancel his takeoff; and to exit at Taxiway B and advise Ground Control of his intentions. The instructor acknowledged. Aircraft X called once again to request taxi clearance; and I coordinated with Ground Control to taxi him; issuing him the Brasher warning. The instructor acknowledged; said he'd switch to Ground Control. I continued to scramble on Local 2 to receive additional aircraft that were shipped to me for arrival to Runway 30L; along with doing my best to provide watch supervision as the CIC (Controller in Charge). The controller in training at Ground control helped me with some of the watch supervision tasks; such as handling internal and outside calls to the tower cab. Later on; the pilot called the facility promptly and was transferred to personnel downstairs to discuss the event. He was reportedly very apologetic and seemed well aware of the wrong runway landing. The other controller that took his call advised they had a positive and productive conversation. This event took place during a busy rush with high volume and complexity and was a 'squeeze play' to get Aircraft X across the Local 1 final. Controller expectation bias played a role here; as I watched the aircraft appear to cross the Runway 30R final before I turned my attention to the other aircraft in my pattern. In my scan; I did not see in time that the aircraft instead lined up for the wrong runway. Local 1's awareness and swift action was commendable in response to the event. I believe the lesson here is continue to stay vigilant and keep scanning and watching for things that may be out of place. Pilot expectation bias may have also occurred here; as the aircraft was originally sequenced to Runway 30R and then changed over to Runway 30L. Being issued a new tower frequency on the base leg can definitely increase the pilot's workload at a critical time and it might be more desirable to have the aircraft remain on downwind while making that frequency change in the future; if feasible. In fact; there is a work group reviewing these kinds of issues right now. The work group is expected to develop some best practices for the use of Local 2 and more standardized procedures to issue frequency changes and split the two Local positions. I have provided some input to date and eagerly await their findings. In the long run; their work will help provide a more standardized and less chaotic approach to splitting our Locals; which should ultimately enhance safety of the operation.Additional staffing that afternoon; even one more controller; would have allowed the CIC/Supervisor position to be worked stand alone in the cab; split from Local 2. During good weather our traffic numbers should reflect that on this day; afternoon rush is fairly common. Having an additional set of eyes in the cab might have spotted Aircraft X line up for the wrong runwaysooner; allowing faster corrective action to be taken. Traffic is up significantly in recent months; yet we are continuing to work many shifts with limited staffing or where the Supervisor and/or controllers in training are used for coverage. Better staffing and/or watch supervision in the future would help ensure improved oversight of the operation during peak traffic periods and should also help ensure we have the resources to effectively train our newer controllers.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
681,681,681,681,8610,A corporate jet departed and I radar identified them and issued a climb to FL190. I noticed the corporate jet turning a mile off the departure end; and thought they were joining the radial on the Porte departure. However; their turn continued past the radial and that's when I quickly issued a 280 heading and amended altitude of 5;000 to avoid the Air Carrier who was the previous departure. The Air Carrier was west of the airport headed south and the corporate jet's turn and climb rate caused them to quickly converge with the Air Carrier. That's when separation was lost.

682,682,682,682,2808,Aircraft X; was on the SALT LAKE 3 departure. When he reached TCH VOR; he made a sharp right turn; in what I assume was an attempt to join the TCH 094 radial. I observed this; however the tower had not shipped the aircraft to departure frequency yet. I called to the tower to see if they still had the aircraft; because he was at a dangerously low altitude and only cleared to climb to 10;000 MSL with multiple higher MVA's in his flight path. Unless he was given a corrective vector back to the north; not only would he be in danger with terrain; but he also would have entered an active [stadium] TFR.I called Local Center to make sure the tower was aware of the situation. I asked if they were talking to Aircraft X; to which the tower controller replied no. He then asked the other tower controllers. At this point; instead of taking any corrective action for themselves; they changed the aircraft to my frequency. On his initial check in; I turned the aircraft to a 340 heading (what he should have been on) and the pilot responded that he was heading 120. I then asked him if he could maintain his own terrain and obstruction clearance below 11;000 MSL. The aircraft replied that he could; so I re-issued the turn to a 340 heading; and the aircraft turned. I'm not sure what to say about preventing the re-occurrence of this event. I don't know that the aircraft got the correct clearance from the tower. I do however; feel fairly confident that if the tower had been paying more attention to the departure or if the aircraft had been on my frequency instead of tower's; I could have corrected this situation before it became an issue. This is a systemic issue with Salt Lake Tower. They frequently retain communication with departure aircraft for extended periods of time or distance when providing no service and/or when TRACON could be providing better; safer; or more expeditious service. The bottom line is; if that aircraft is on Tower's frequency; I should not have had to alert them to the fact that the aircraft had come off the departure; they should have recognized it themselves. Furthermore; the tower needs to ensure all conflicts are resolved before frequency change to departure.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
683,683,683,683,10561,On my initial climb out I set my autopilot to heading mode and altitude at 3000'. I turned heading to 130 to intercept the [on-course] radial and continued to climb. I was instructed by ATC to continue my climb to 6000'. As I was talking to ATC and setting up altitude changes my autopilot must have disconnected. As I looked back I saw that I had entered an unusual attitude and began a recovery sequence. I recovered the loss of control of the aircraft but had lost significant altitude and my heading was stabilized in somewhat of a westerly direction. I was given further instructions by [ATC] with a vector to intercept the airway. The remainder of my flight to destination was uneventful.I can only add that I am so thankful to the many instructors who schooled me on upset recovery procedures. This was indeed a very sobering experience and has given me a new perspective on IFR flights. Number one lesson learned is to not trust the autopilot without constant monitoring of the flight instruments. Number two; although a successful outcome; I believe I could have controlled loss of altitude better.

686,686,686,686,2705,During an instrument training flight with a student; upon contact with Detroit Departure shortly after takeoff from YIP; I requested to fly a VOR-A approach at Plymouth-Canton Mettetal airport (1D2).

688,688,688,688,2156,We were approximately 140 miles east of MIE VORTAC at FL340 proceeding direct to MIE with NAV engaged. We were given a clearance to cross 110 miles east of MIE at FL300. I was performing pilot monitoring duties at the time. We created a Place/Distance waypoint in the FMS based off of MIE. The FMS inserted the waypoint at the proper distance; but as is often the case with the Airbus; the 'direct' line to MIE showed a slight bend after the PD waypoint. Because this is very common; I double checked the mileage and was satisfied that the point was inserted correctly. After a minute or so; the Controller asked us if we were still going direct to MIE. We responded 'Affirmative.' After another minute passed; the Controller indicated that he was showing that we needed to turn 10 degrees right for direct MIE. Knowing what was causing the difference; we elected to just select direct MIE again (deleting the PD waypoint) and perform the vertical calculation manually. After selecting direct to MIE (we remained engaged in NAV during this whole sequence) the airplane turned slightly back to the right. I explained to the Controller that sometimes when we insert Place/Distance way points; the FMS creates a slight bend explaining our turn from 'Direct'. He then made a comment that was something to the effect of 'Yeah; that issue was just brought up at a meeting we had last week.' But he never indicated whether he considered what we had done as acceptable or not. Because we needed to devote our attention to initiating our descent to comply with the altitude crossing restriction clearance; I did not ask him for additional clarification. We complied with the altitude crossing restriction and were subsequently turned over to another frequency.

689,689,689,689,4223,I experienced a runway-excursion while performing touch and go's on Runway XX. Below is a detailed account of the events leading up to and post incident. I requested flight following from ZZZ and received the ATIS information upon entering ZZZ1 airspace. Winds were 180 degrees at 10 knots; Runway XX in use; altimeter 29.81. I contacted Tower requesting full stop. My initial landing was uneventful requiring minimal crosswind correction remaining on the centerline until directed by Tower to exit Taxiway X and go to Ground. I taxied back to the active and requested closed traffic. I was cleared takeoff Runway XX; left closed traffic approved. Once on the left downwind I was cleared touch and go Runway XX. Turning base to final; I noticed some minor buffeting and that I overshot final slightly. Wind check was given as 160 Degrees at 10 knots as I recall. I was over the centerline when I crossed the runway marking numbers and as I descended for landing; significant right rudder was required to keep the plane straight. Left aileron was applied to keep the upwind wing down and everything looked good up to the point of touchdown.Upon touching down at 60 - 65 kts.; the plane veered sharply to the left and I believe the nose wheel briefly lifted of the ground and touched back down although I can't say for sure. I tried to regain directional control of the plane and get it going back along the runway centerline but was unable to break the plane's left turning trajectory. Pushing the right rudder pedal didn't seem to straighten out the aircraft. I saw that I was approaching Taxiway X so I applied the brakes more aggressively hoping to reduce my speed enough to either exit on Taxiway X or decelerate enough on the grass strip between the runway and taxiway so as to not hit some antenna equipment father down in the grass. I was concerned with not injuring anyone; causing a prop strike or damaging the wings so I stayed with the controls flying the plane to the safest stopping point I could. Crash Fire Rescue was at the site within 3 minutes. I notified Tower that I was the only soul on board and that I was OK. I asked Tower if I could stop the engine and get out to inspect the damage as I thought the plane was not movable. Once outside and while preforming a walk around; I was met by one of the airport operations employees. After that; a few more operations people arrived; along with the fire department and paramedics. They asked if I was OK to which I replied yes.

690,690,690,690,6345,While working the departure pit; I amended a flight plan on a C560 who had filed PBI direct SAV. I applied the correct routing from PBI to SAV on a between the pluses amendment indicating that only this portion of the route needed to be read to the pilot. Subsequently; I noticed that the remainder of the routing to the destination was not the preferential routing so I made another amendment to change the entire route. This time I forgot to apply pluses or indicate in the remarks that an amendment had been made. Thus; no amendment was read to the pilot and he was cleared 'as filed.' The aircraft entered ZJX on a routing different from what was coordinated electronically and has been properly processed as an operational deviation. I have been making amendments exactly like this pretty much everyday.

691,691,691,691,6570,While descending into IAH on the DRLLR 5 arrival we experienced wake turbulence at DOMNO. The autopilot initiated the desired left turn but at less than 5 degrees of left bank; the aircraft suddenly rolled right to approximately 20 degrees of right bank. The autopilot remained engaged and immediately corrected back to a left turn to the correct course. The short delay in the turn caused us to go approximately 1 mile off course. ATC noticed and asked if we were going direct to ZOEEE. When I reported to them that we had experienced wake turbulence. I initially used the term 'severe'. When they asked me to confirm that it was severe turbulence I corrected it to 'strong but not severe'. It wasn't so much the strength of the turbulence but the sudden nature and the fact that it occurred exactly when we should have been turning left. I doubt anyone in the back of the aircraft even noticed. ATC asked me to call them after landing and provided a phone number. After landing I called and their only question was if there were any injuries. I told them there were none and reiterated that my initial statement of 'severe' was incorrect. The event was actually very mild; just poorly timed. Additionally; I am using the term 'wake' turbulence because it felt like every other wake turbulence encounter I have had; but I don't recall there being an aircraft in front of us on the arrival.

On climb out approximately 5000 ft through transition altitude on the departure both myself and the Captain reached down to set our altimeters. As this was happening I noticed that the Captain inadvertently continued a turn past the course line for the departure. As we were turning through the course I alerted him that he was doing so and called for a correction. He was still heads down setting the altimeter and started to further raise the nose up in the climbing turn. He started his correction back the other way but the nose was too high and the airspeed started to decay rapidly. I immediately noticed the yellow barber pole rising up to meet our speed bug (approx. 220-230) at an alarming rate. As the nose was still too high in a bank and the speed tape continued to decrease to the stick shaker; I alerted him then immediately took control of the Aircraft and performed a nose high turning unusual attitude recovery back to level and accelerating.

I stated to the flying pilot that we were not on course; which he agreed. I then stated that he should turn to the right so as to get on course. At that time; New York Departure gave us a turn to the heading of 260 degrees which corresponded to the departure procedure. We made the requested turn and continued the climb.

696,696,696,696,6506,I was working Local Control which manages the class D during north flow operations. Aircraft X had been doing air work at an adjacent airport which is about 8 to 9 miles west of this airport. Aircraft Y was inbound on the ILS. Aircraft Z and Aircraft A were inbound from the southwest. Approach called for a point out to Flight Data/Clearance delivery on Aircraft X and when asked what he was going to do we were told he was going back towards the adjacent airport. Aircraft X entered from the southwest and made maneuvers about 2 to 3 southwest at 2;300 feet and then turned southeast directly overflying Aircraft Y on the ILS by 400 feet. Aircraft Y was issued traffic alerts and broken off the approach to a 090 heading. This put them in conflict with Aircraft B; inbound from the southeast. Another traffic alert was given to Aircraft Y for Aircraft B. Just before Aircraft Y was broken off the ILS approach; Aircraft Z a VFR inbound from the southwest was issued a traffic alert since Aircraft X initially turned opposite direction to them. Aircraft A VFR from the southwest also had to be diverted to the east prior to Aircraft Y being broken off the approach because Aircraft X's intentions were unpredictable and not as described. When asked why flight check was turning east (right instead of left) toward our traffic we were told by approach that 'it is what it is.'Flight Check operations are a high risk to anyone else operating in the area. When they arrive their intentions are incredibly vague other than what they are checking. They often seem to just do whatever they want and let you know as they are doing it. From a local standpoint I think that flight check needs to be a lot more clear of their exact intentions) while operating in the vicinity. VFR arrivals need to be rerouted or placed in holding by approach to a different quadrant other than the one that Flight Check is operating in.

We departed Runway XX and on the takeoff roll received a caution for EFIS COMP MON. I called it out; Captain said continue. On the climb out at 400 feet the Captain's (PF) showed a left turn to 340 and asked me to set 340. I said set and then we realized his display wasn't working so we transferred controls to my side. We then leveled off at 4;000 feet notified ATC of the loss of lateral navigation and asked for vectors back to the field. As we were turning we realized my HSI was providing unreliable heading information as well. ATC gave us degree amounts for the turn and we backed it up with the standby compass. We also asked ATC for a descent into visual conditions they gave us 3;000 feet and then 2;000 feet and finally 1;600 feet. The Pilot Monitoring briefed the approach. We went to green needles and ATC gave us a heading to intercept and the ILS for XX and told us it would be a left turn. We started down with a GS lock that seemed to match ATC instructions.

698,698,698,698,9684,On the Job Training (OJT) was being conducted on local control. Aircraft X was inbound on the VOR approach for a full stop. The VOR approach is off of a VOR and to the right runway. This approach has the pilot fly over the approach end of the left runway since the parallels are staggered and the right runway actually is further. The pilot was lined up for the left and descending when the developmental was notified and the Aircraft was sent around for another approach.The VOR approach is set up for the right runway and its setting pilots up for failure and possibly a wrong surface landing. If their head is in the instruments on an instrument approach; when they hit minimums and look up they will see our longest runway; the left and the PAPI's; not the right which is where they are cleared to land. CNO has a problem with wrong runway landings and having the VOR approach set up for the right runway is only going to have IFR pilots land on the wrong runway. If the VOR approach were to be set up for the left; it would also allow some versatility to TRACON and the operation since it would open up an instrument approach to another runway.

699,699,699,699,2024,We departed PAWG on the obstacle departure procedure toward LVD VOR. Our next waypoint was YYJ; which was approximately a 140 degree turn to the left. After accelerating above 10;000 FT (we had been cleared to FL280); our FMS commanded a predictive turn toward YYJ before crossing LVD. During the turn; we selected direct YYJ; which centered our course needle and our turn radius decreased. Some time after this; Anchorage Center established radar contact with us and asked us if we had crossed the LVD VOR on our departure. We explained the FMS predictive turn but the Controller implied that we had made a lateral navigation error. We were not informed of any pilot deviation nor given a phone number to contact during or after the flight. At no time was obstacle clearance an issue for us; but we felt that we didn't want to cause any confusion with the controlling facility. In the future; we will fly this procedure using short range navigation source (raw data) to prevent having our waypoint dropped by the FMS and turning early as it anticipates the course change.

We were cleared for takeoff while turning onto [the taxiway] for XXL. The Captain gave me control of the throttles upon entering the runway after we confirmed we would be doing a rolling takeoff. After the Captain aligned the aircraft on the centerline; he gave me the controls to continue the takeoff. I increased the throttles to 40% for stabilization and the aircraft began yawing to the right. I was unable to correct the yawing using left rudder and advised the captain that I had no directional control. He stated that he had the aircraft and was rejecting. He closed the throttles; disconnected the autothrottles and also put in the reversers as the aircraft yawed back to the left. Once we had the aircraft stabilized; I advised tower that we were rejected the takeoff and advised the passengers to remain seated. The tower asked if we needed any assistance and after determining we didn't have any serious engine indications; we said no. They advised us we could take any taxiway off the runway. We took the reverse highspeed and proceeded to the run up pad for XXL to assess the situation. Once there; the Captain spoke with the flight attendants; passengers and maintenance.

701,701,701,701,7023,On a long straight in approach to Runway XX at ZZZ. Winds were out of the north 350 at 13. Crosswind correction to the left on approach. Descending through pattern altitude adding flaps maintaining center line. Told student to be prepared for right rudder correction to straighten the plane before landing and to add left aileron for crosswind. On approach there were 4 helicopters idling and preparing to depart. Two fairly close to XX. I was thinking rotor wash might be an issue but winds should have blown that away from XX. Upon crossing threshold; power was reduced. Brought my attention away from the helicopters back to the landing phase and I don't believe the student put any right rudder in to straighten us out. We touched down and the plane either caught a gust or solid crosswind that pushed it off center line to the right. We started sliding on the runway nose pointed left and I did would I could to take control back to straighten the rudders and get left aileron up. Student had a frozen grip on the yoke and too much pressure on rudders to simply straighten us out. I think he was also braking at the same time. The right wing then dipped down. We started to correct but by then the tail had risen fairly high causing the nose to dip down and the prop to strike. The strike was hardly noticeable so although I believed at the time that we hit; I thought it could also have been the right wing. I think the prop strike helped the plane to straighten out allowing us to brake and exit the runway. The engine sound did not change and seemed to be running fine so we taxied to the ramp and shut down. In hind sight; there were two options. First was to do a go-around. If the helicopters were a concern; we could have gone around the pattern once they cleared out. The other option was to have more deliberate backup control to force in the left aileron and right rudder while managing the crosswind. I believe strongly in talking students through what to expect and having just done that inbound to XX I felt that he understood the instruction.

705,705,705,705,7868,The conditions were at night in VMC with winds about 20-40 degrees right at about 10-15 kts. Prevailing conditions earlier during the day were generally windy at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots. During the FO (First Officer) landing flare the right wing dropped at an abrupt rate which caused the Captain's hands to come up and quickly level out the yoke. The Captain only touched the yoke for less than 1 second and the plane recovered to wings level attitude for a slightly long landing. The Captain never took control of the aircraft away from the FO. It appeared that the aircraft had been in no more than 3-4 degrees of right bank for less than 1-2 seconds and the remainder of the landing was slightly long but uneventful. We continued taxi to the assigned gate and finished our debrief and post- flight inspection with no damage discovered at that time. Damage to the right wingtip was discovered 3 days later by another crew at another location. This event may have been caused by such a slight wingtip scrape that it did not seem that the wingtip ever touched the runway during the landing flare. Neither pilot felt like we had scraped a wingtip and therefore did not bring up the possibility that we might need to inspect the wingtip for any specific damage during that specific trip leg. A routine visual post flight inspection was accomplished with a flashlight at night. The landing crosswinds were well within the range for FO 15 knot crosswind limitations. If we were the crew that caused the damage; it was not discovered by any other crews for 3 full days of flying. There were also 3 days' worth of other crews that may have caused the damage that was not noticed. Also add emphasis of rudder control during landing and flare to minimize and balance the amount of Aileron usage during crosswind landing. The rudder was never mentioned during any of my training in new hire or upgrade; and the rudder may not be used enough by pilots company-wide to maintain centerline during crosswind landings; perhaps leading to a higher rate of wingtip strikes.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
706,706,706,706,8038,We arrived ZZZ about 20 min early. We had to wait for a gate. Ramp control assigned us to holding spot [A]. Aircraft Y (an A320) was ahead of us on the taxiway. Ramp assigned them to spot [B]. They arrived there first; and then we followed into holding spot A. There was also Aircraft Z on spot [C].We were advised by [company] operations that we were waiting for a flight to depart [a gate]. We listened to ground control and heard [the flight] receive its pushback clearance. We advised ramp that our gate was opening. Ramp cleared us to taxi from holding spot A to spot D; and then to contact ground control.As I began to taxi from spot A; I noted that we were centered on our line (A) and that Aircraft Y was centered on their line B. I began a slow taxi while looking out my side window at our left wing. After I thought that my left wing tip was clear of the Airbus; I turned my head back forward to continue taxi. A few seconds later; I felt a moderate bump and the nose pulled to the left (I estimate about a 12-18 inches over a period of about 1 second?) I stopped the airplane; not immediately sure what had happened. (I wondered if we had perhaps rolled into a misplaced chock? with our left main tire.) It took a few seconds for my mind to process the fact that our wing tip had struck the Airbus.We stopped the taxi; set the parking brake; and advised ramp that we thought we may have struck the wing of the adjacent airplane. We also advised [company] operations. After a few minutes; operations advised that airport Ground Safety teams would come out to inspect the airplanes. We made a PA announcement to the passengers advising that we may have struck the other airplane and that our taxi would be delayed pending analysis. We advised them that we might need to be towed to the gate or that we might need to deplane at this location and board busses to the terminal.Numerous ground safety vehicles arrived on the scene. Many inspectors began taking photos of the wingtips and the position of the airplanes. (During this time; none of the inspectors were communicating with us via radio or intercom.) This went on for at least 45 minutes. We contacted [company] operations to determine how we would handle the passengers. Eventually; we learned that an air stair would be brought to the airplane and that passengers would be bussed to the terminal. We advised the passengers.After some time; an air stair was brought to the airplane. Initially; airport operations brought the air stair to door 2R. (There were numerous vehicles blocking access to door 1L.) Since this was a 737-900; we (the pilots) realized that this presented a possible 'tail tip' risk as passengers moved aft to deplane. So we stopped the deplaning before it started. We talked to the ground safety people out the window to explain the tail tip risk. We got the airport operations people to reposition the air stair to door 1R for deplaning. The passengers deplaned and were taken to the terminal. Vehicles were arranged to take the flight attendants and pilots to their various operations. Discussion items/Causes:1. Plot X holding points A and B. Aircraft sizes and limitations.While ground safety people were documenting the wingtip contact; I spoke through the flight deck window with several of the investigators. They advised me that both airplanes were; in fact; centered on their respective hold point lines. The Ground Safety investigators advised me further that; according to documents that they had; that 2 mainline narrow body airplanes were not supposed to be parked adjacent to one another at holding points A and B. They indicated that 2 mainline narrow body airplanes could be parked at adjacent to each other at B and C; but not at A and B.We were familiar with [company] page 10-7 that shows the location of Plot X. That page has a Note that limits aircraft size to 757-300 or smaller. There are no other notes on that page that show any other limitations. While waiting for the ground safety people to finish their analysis and documentation; we reviewed all [company] 10-7 pages and airport pages. We found no addition limitations on aircraft size or pairings related to holding spots A and B in our pilot operating charts.2. Wingtip clearance perception while on a published centerline.I had verified that both our airplane and Aircraft Y were centered on their respective hold point centerlines before I began to taxi. This led me to expectation bias on the subsequent attempt to taxi out of the hold point. We taxi past other airplanes with minimal wingtip clearance routinely at ZZZ. When doing so; we routinely verify that both airplanes are centered on their respective taxi lines. When they are; we routinely pass 'close'; but reliably clear. Thus; we come to 'expect' that being on the centerline will result in a close; but clear; passing. In short; we trust where the lines are drawn. Therefore; when passing the other airplane; our thought process is more directed toward 'when' we are clear (and able to turn); less on 'if' we are clear. Both airplanes being on centerline brings the expectation that we will be laterally clear; watching the wingtips 'verifies' that the expected clearance occurs. Repeating this experience hundreds of times solidifies that expectation. Thus; in my mind; as I was looking at my wing tip; my thinking was more on 'when' our wingtip was past the Airbus; and less on 'if' we would clear.So as I looked back toward my wing tip; I saw my winglet; from my vantage point; 'to the left of' (and therefore; likely longitudinally 'further aft than') the Airbus winglet. As we proceeded forward; from my perspective; I saw what I thought was my winglet 'passing' the Airbus winglet. My winglet was; from my perspective; now 'to the right of' (and; I thought; longitudinally 'forward of') the Airbus. Since it was night; depth perception was reduced; and so I did not perceive that my wingtip was laterally 'inside of' the Airbus wingtip. Nor did I have any expectation that this could be likely; given that we were both centered on our taxi lines.3. Communication with Ground Safety personnel during investigation and deplaning.I felt that we received inadequate communication from Ground Safety investigators during their investigation and documentation process. There was no dedicated 'communicator' to speak with us on the flight deck. No one hooked up to the intercom to keep posted on what was going on. As a result; I felt like I didn't know what was going on; and I was not able to communicate as much information to our passengers as I would have liked.Once the airport operations people began preparing for passenger deplaning; 2 safety threats occurred. First; poor coordination with the airport operations personnel produced a threat of an inadvertent slide deployment. They decided to bring an air stair to door 2R instead of door 1L. We had previously advised the flight attendants that an air stair would be coming to the airplane within a few minutes. But we did not see the air stair approaching door 2R from the flight deck. So we didn't know the air stair was approaching. The main cabin doors were still armed at this point. The aft flight attendants saw the air stair approaching and advised both us and the purser; fortunately; we got the doors disarmed before the air stair arrived at door 2R.Second; as discussed above; deplaning from 2R instead of a forward door involved the risk of a tail tip. We were not consulted about a plan as to which door would be used for deplaning; so we had to scramble to stop the deplaning from door 2R and redirect it to door 1R.My main point in this section is to say that the communication and coordination with the ground safety and airport operations people could be much improved by having a dedicated ground-to-airplane 'communicator' to coordinate with the crew on all these issues.4. Increased operations at ZZZ during summer monthsFrom my perspective; ZZZ has seen greatly increased operations this summer. This has resulted in much higher utilization of [company] gates. This; in turn; results in higher utilization of the various holding points around the airport as aircraft wait for a gate. I believe that this may have been creating difficulty for [company] Ramp and Operations in finding any place to park airplanes in the moments prior to our event. This may have led to errors in assigning which airplanes can appropriately park at holding spots A and B.5. Duty day and FatigueThis was a 1 day turn with a Deadhead segment to ZZZ1; followed by an operating segment from ZZZ1 to ZZZ. Although the duty day was somewhat long; I do not feel that fatigue was an issue for me in this incident.6. Inadvertent IPAD Lock Function riskWhile approaching Plot X after landing; I attempted to open my IPAD to ZZZ 10-7. I was unable to do so as the 'DEVICE LOCKED' icon appeared. I did not initially know why it appeared. Since I was unable to pull up the desire page; I asked the first officer to expand the view of Plot X on his IPAD; which he did. I referenced the location of spot A by looking cross-cockpit on the first officer's IPAD.Once parked at spot A; I noted that the 'locked' icon in the upper right corner of my IPAD showed yellow and locked. I think this may have occurred during approach; I had swiped down from the Battery icon to reduce the brightness of my display. I am guessing that I may have bumped the 'LOCK' icon and inadvertently locked my IPAD.I bring this up to highlight a potential risk to ground operations only. I do not feel that this had any effect on our events that evening; I am very familiar with Plot X and was able to reference the First Officer's IPAD while approaching A. While parked at A; and before our event; I had unlocked my IPAD and had page 10-7 displayed.7. Wing Illumination LightI did not use the wing illumination light to light up my wing tip during the event. It occurred to me after the event that this might have been helpful with depth perception. But I do not see that as a procedure in the Flight Manual or FOM; and I do not recall ever being taught that as a technique for taxiing with close wingtip clearance.8. DebriefingsThe First Officer and I did some debriefing of our event in the flight deck while the ground safety investigation/documentation process was underway. More debriefing occurred in the flight office with the help of ALPA personnel. We also met the crew of the A320 in the flight office and debriefed with them as well. I felt all of these debriefings were adequate.I feel that we did not debrief as well as I would have liked with the flight attendants. By the time the passengers had left; there was considerable pressure for all crew to get off the airplane so that maintenance could tow it. So we didn't get much of a chance to debrief with them. In retrospect; I feel that I should have carved out more time after passenger deplaning to debrief with the flight attendants.Summary/Recommendations:1. Ground Safety Personnel told us that according to their documents; a 737 and an A320 are not supposed to be parked side-by-side at holding points A and B. But we have no such information on our pilot operating charts.2. A combination of expectation bias and reduced depth perception at night caused me to fail to recognize that my wingtip was inside the A320 wingtip.3. I would recommend that anytime airport operations or Ground Safety personnel are handling a situation like ours; that a dedicated 'ground-to-airplane' communicator be assigned to improve coordination.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
707,707,707,707,5278,An airport vehicle closed a third of the only active paved runway in the middle of the day during peak traffic for absolutely no reason resulting in a compounding safety issue. I am late filing this report because I thought another controller had already filed and I was busy with other matters.Runway 8 in use. Wind favoring Runway 8 by about 8 knots. Traffic was increasing. FAA Maintenance requested permission to enter the Runway 26 safety area to replace a threshold light. I asked FAA if they are able to remain clear of the runway surface for the operation. FAA confirmed that they only need the safety area; not the runway. I put FAA in the safety area and clear of the runway at all times. I issued traffic information on FAA to my Runway 8 arrivals and departures since FAA is just off the departure end of Runway 8.FAA completed their operation and exited the safety area. A few minutes later FAA asked Tower permission to enter the safety area for Runway 8 this time; again to replace a runway threshold light. I asked FAA if they are able to remain clear of the runway surface for the operation. FAA confirmed that they only needed the safety area; not the runway. Understanding this; I elected to hold FAA short of the runway for a few moments as to not introduce a new hazard to the Runway Safety Area (RSA) while traffic is on short final for Runway 8; as it didn't give enough time for the pilot to object.[Airport ops worker] tells the tower that they are going to close the runway west of Charlie intersection after the traffic lands. I informed [Airport ops worker] that I need the runway for other ongoing operations; and also inform him that the FAA vehicle does not need a runway closure. [Airport ops worker] insisted that they are closing the runway anyway. I have a back in forth with [Airport ops worker] about the arriving and departing traffic in the queue that require full runway. I ask if [Airport ops worker] would like to just come back in the evening instead of during peak traffic. [Airport ops worker] declines; and insists that he will close the runway after the traffic land/depart.The runway is shown closed west of Taxiway Charlie. [Airport ops worker] proceeds on the closed portion from Bravo. FAA is not put on the runway and is instructed to proceed in the RSA and to remain clear of the runway at all times. Aircraft X calls Tower on a straight in for Runway 8. Aircraft X was told to fly straight in to Runway 8 shortened and that the runway is closed west of Charlie. (First 2;100 feet out of 8;850 feet) [Airport ops worker] decides to drive down to the Charlie intersection and park on the centerline. There is no demarcation for this closure other than a 150 foot wide intersection. [Airport ops worker] is parked on or past the easternmost edge of the intersection. FAA finished their operation and exited the RSA; again never entering the runway.[Airport ops worker] announced that he will remain in place on the centerline until the next aircraft lands despite FAA being complete with his operation. Aircraft X appears to be on course to touch down near the middle of the Charlie intersection. About 20-50 feet off of the ground aircraft X has to make a sudden juke to the right to swerve around the truck on the centerline; and literally flies around the truck and back to the runway to touch down. Aircraft X exited the runway without incident. [Airport ops worker] exited the runway and reopened the runway.First of all I cannot express how much my blood is boiling a week later from writing this. I have had the privilege of performing this great job for 15 years without hearing or seeing anyone get hurt or killed on my frequency. The fact that a procedure is being used and supported today that encourages that sort of result for no reason at all other than to demonstrate who has a bigger stick is irresponsible; dangerous and just outright spits in the face of every safety conscious effort that has been made inthe last 7 years to improve the National Aviation Services (NAS).FAA did not need/want the runway closed in the first place. [Airport ops worker] did not need to keep the runway closed after FAA left. [Airport ops worker] did not need to be parked on the centerline; so close to the new unmarked threshold. He essentially violated the 7:1 RSA for this new unmarked threshold.I have seen thousands of aircraft land Runway 8 in my tenure at Juneau. If the runway would have never closed this is exactly how this situation plays out. The vehicles goes in the RSA short of the runway. Aircraft X wants to exit at Charlie; 2;100 feet down. Aircraft X does not even touch down until 1;000 feet down the 8;850 feet runway; well above the vehicle in the RSA. It is no factor at all; I will put a paycheck on that.With the scenario that [Airport ops worker] forced us into aircraft X still would want to be off as soon as possible which is Taxiway Delta; 1;200 feet from the Charlie intersection. Aircraft X will land as close to Charlie as possible; this time much closer to the 'threshold'; this one being unmarked; and therefor much closer to the vehicle. Essentially touching down 100 feet down the 6;750 foot runway. Less runway available; no markings; closer to a vehicle that wasn't even doing something productive. I can't really say this any other way.The FAA ATC division needs to stop supporting these temporary runway closures. I'm sick and tired of hearing that no one can do anything about it because Airport Division makes the call on what they do with their runways. If airports want to show their muscles and close a runway; then ATC should hold people until the runway is available again or proper coordination/publication/demarcation is accomplished. If they need to take the runway to do their job; that is just fine. I have no problem waiting until they give me the runway back so I can continue doing my job. Traffic is light at night; making it a more suitable time to work on the runway rather than the [middle of the] afternoon during a recovery. During daytime traffic we do make every reasonable effort to accommodate access to the runway; but our primary responsibility is moving airplanes.Whatever happens I just hope someone figures it out before winter. The old snow removal foremen have used this procedure over the years with mostly success; but they have been very humble; flexible and great at coordinating with the Tower. They are on their way out and if we have this new day time foreman apply his 'bigger stick' attitude to imposed runway closures on an icy runway with little to no coordination I feel like we will see an accident in the near future.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

710,710,710,710,824,On our way back to [base]; we noticed oil spilling through the seams of the engine nacelle which covered our windscreen. The oil spill momentarily stopped; but gradually increased again; with oil gushing over the top of the cowling. At this point; we began to divert to [a suitable alternate] 12 miles northeast of our position. The engine started to make a grinding sound and we were unable to maintain altitude; with airspeed beginning to drop. Due to the copious amounts of oil on the windscreen; depth and distance became incredibly difficult to judge. We were about 8 miles southwest of the airport when altitude was no longer sustainable. I aimed for a green field; with forward visibility extremely limited; and saw a road last minute at 300 feet and made a 45 degree bank and landed on the road. We landed hard on the pavement and veered into the dirt on the left and did a 180 degree spin and came to rest next to a ditch.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Student got off the center line and I advise him to keep centerline and prepare to turn left again by reducing airspeed. At same time I finished giving student pilot those instructions; he added full power instead of reducing it. That action was faster than my reaction time to counteract. Immediately and simultaneously; I hit the brakes steering away from the hangar on the right that we were pointed at and pulled the throttle out. The right wingtip light hit the corner of hangar door. Wingtip lights were completely broken and there was a hole the size of a lime in the wingtip. The hangar door had a scratch on the corner where the wingtip hit. No other damages were found.

We inched along at a snails pace and from my perspective we looked to have about 4 to 5 feet of wing clearance. I was watching the wing as we contacted the tail strake of the aircraft parked to our right with our right wingtip. From my vantage point I thought we were clear. I clearly misjudged the distance.

Also; after the incident; a tower personnel confirmed that the tower had confirmed that my landing gear was down before I landed.As I landed; the gear gave way and collapsed causing the aircraft to skid down the runway on its belly. This caused me to block the only runway and resulted in the closing of the airport for approximately 2 hours until my plane could be removed off the runway.My Comanche had recently passed its annual and I had passed my flight review within the last month.

718,718,718,718,7874,A Beechcraft Duchess (BE-76) landed gear-up during a practice single-engine GPS circling approach in Visual Meteorological Conditions.  Two occupants (Instructor and Student) were uninjured.  The aircraft sustained minimal damage and was towed off the runway after being lifted and landing gear was extended.  (1) This was the last flight for the student in the FAA Approved Part 141 flight curriculum prior to his Commercial Pilot checkride.  (No serious issues had occurred previously and ONLY one more landing was needed).(2) Student was flying within the standards specified in the Practical Test Standards (PTS).  (Student was following all procedures; making all the required company procedural callouts and radio calls.  Everything was normal which caused the Instructor to drop his guard and not watch as closely as he should have). (3) During the approach; the landing gear warning horn continuous sounds due to the company procedure stating single-engine circling approaches are flown with the landing gear up until in a position where the landing can be made.  (Instructor and student became DE-sensitized hearing the horn during all the previous approaches and ignored it).(4) Turning onto the Base Leg; student advised 'Leaving MDA' but did not lower the landing gear.  (Instructor was looking for traffic and did not visually see the gear handle was still in the UP position).(5) Just when the student would have stated 'Verify' landing gear down position; Instructor asked if student had his aiming point for touchdown.  Student responded 'Yes'.  (Instructor's question; at that point of the approach; may have interrupted student's concentration resulting in student thinking he may have done the 'Verify' callout).(6) Due to lack of drag from the landing gear; the approach was 10 knots fast resulting in minimal time to complete the BEFORE LANDING CHECKLIST.HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:(1) Perceptions:  The student was performing flawlessly and was on his last flight before his checkride.  Instructor dropped his guard and did not catch the fact that the landing gear had not been extended.  (2)  Judgement: Instructor's objective evaluation of the student's performance was skewed because Instructor had seen this student make great improvements in all areas culminating in this last flight.  Instructor's focus was wanting to see this student be successful and finish the course.SUMMATION:  Instructors are the 'Safety Net' for their students.  Instructor(s) need to be cautious and vigilant throughout the entire flight training curriculum segment (i.e. Lesson 1; 24; or 59).  A student can be as dangerous at the end of their training with hours logged; as a new student with little to no hours.  Mistakes will happen.

719,719,719,719,1864,I was leaving RFD; having been parked in a hangar [northeast of Runway 19]. I was unfamiliar with the airport. I had picked up the ATIS and caught 1 or 25 as departing runways. When I called for my taxi clearance; I also asked for VFR flight following to be set up; and it was. After some confusion over the departure runways; I was offered; and accepted; progressive taxi to Runway 25. That was a left turn from the hangar area down Juliet? I didn't know how close I was; and when I saw Foxtrot; I asked if I should go there. I was told no; Runway 25 was my destination and I was at the end of 25. Seeing hold short lines all over the place; my first concern was that I had crossed the hold short line; but the controller told me to do my run-up right there where I was. AT THAT POINT I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED; COLLECTED MY THOUGHTS; AND REVIEWED THE AIRPORT DIAGRAM; BUT I DIDN'T. This is when my mind put me ON THE RUNWAY; BUT I WAS TOLD TO DO THE RUN-UP SO IT WAS OK. In reality; I was still on a taxiway and had not had a runway incursion. Given the clearance to depart; I was too quick and assumed the taxiway was the runway and proceeded to depart on the taxiway. The Controller told me to 'stop; stop'; which I did; and he explained that I had begun a departure on a taxiway. I was told to do a 180 on the taxiway and come back and depart at the end of Runway 25. Adding insult to injury; when told to switch to departure frequency I managed to stay on Tower. Calling departure I was informed that I was still on Tower. During preflight; I had put Tower frequency on both radios. They were both on the active. When going to departure; I switched radios but not the frequency. Switching frequencies then put me with departure. The rest of the flight went well.Ground Control at destination informed me that RFD requested that I call. I knew what they wanted; and felt really bad about the unpreparedness. I have read of these situations and never considered that I would put myself in one of them. I learned that it is quite possible for me to screw up; and that I need to be more rigorous at every airport and phase of flight. The ultimate cause was hurried confusion; unfamiliarity with the airport; my position on the airport; and not referring to the airport diagram when I was unsure of my position.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
720,720,720,720,8687,A passenger and I took off and flew to [a nearby airport]. The weather was VFR; and even though later in the day we had to go around some rain showers; we remained VFR all day. At this first takeoff with my weight of 160 pounds; my passenger's was 212 pounds; the anchor in the forward compartment; the normal 'stuff' in the back seat and cargo compartment; and 51 gallons of fuel aboard (determined by sticking the tank during preflight); we were 192 pounds under gross and well within our CG limits. We took off from the airport and flew to the lake for lunch; landing and beaching without incident. We left the lake an hour and a half later; flew around some rain showers; and made it back to the lake a half hour later. Listening to the nearby ASOS the wind was out of the northwest; but looking at my windsock it was out of the west and not limp; but not straight out either so I assumed in the 5 to 10 range. I overflew the landing area at 400 FT; while staying over the lake. There appeared to be quite a bit of wave action on the west side of the island; and since there were no boats in the way; I elected to land on the east side of the island fairly close to its shore where the water was relatively calm; even though it gave me a 90 degree cross wind. I have done this many times before in similar conditions with no problem. I was using about 15 inches of MP to help keep the rate of descent low so I would land closer to the north where it was calmest. We touched down just half way down the island with a gentle skip. I eased off back pressure to maintain pitch attitude and added a little power to help set down softer. The second time we bounced higher which really surprised me. I don't know if I hit a boat wake; or some other wave; but I maintained directional control and pitch attitude; adding more power; but not enough to push the nose down. At this point I did not feel that I had enough distance and speed to go around; so continued to try to salvage the landing. The last touchdown was very hard with little airspeed; and I was surprised to find the starboard sponson gone.Directional control while taxiing was harder than usual with the sponson gone and it took me two approaches to get in the lift. With the fuel onboard at the time of landing; before we lost the sponson; we were 258 pounds under gross and still well within the CG envelope. We would not have been on the front edge of the envelope until we burned off 25 more gallons of gas. Looking back on the events the next morning I noticed that we had a very similar wind with the windsock out of the west. This would indicate I probably had a quartering tailwind instead of the direct crosswind I was expecting. With hindsight; I probably should not have even considered what the ASOS said; and paid more attention to the windsock and local conditions.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

722,722,722,722,4633,I was flying with the owner of a tailwheel aircraft who had just purchased the airplane. I was in the right seat as instructor and he was in the left seat as PIC. It was agreed to prior to the flight that he would be the PIC as required by his insurance company. In addition; the airplane only had brakes on the left side; and it was discussed prior to takeoff that the owner would be responsible for application of brakes during the flight. An approach to landing was being made with a 30 degree crosswind; wind speed about 8 KTS. The owner was attempting a wheel landing. He had a slight bounce and the airplane turned to the left; not aligned with the runway.I attempted to recover by applying aileron into the wind and opposite rudder to align with the runway. The airplane was in contact with the ground and I felt that applying full power for a go-around at that point would make the swerve worse and that brakes applied correctly would correct the swerve.

The approach to flare was normal and stabilized at 1;000 ft. Flaps full was selected and auto-brakes medium due to a shorter than normal runway. A runway assessment estimated that the required landing distance was 5;798 ft. using our configuration; and the available landing distance was 7;800 ft. (6;840 ft. landing beyond the glideslope). During the flare; the airplane floated and would not settle. We ended up touching down at the end of the desired touchdown zone. A higher than desired flare and shifting winds may have also contributed to the event. When the airplane began to float the airplane should have been allowed to settle firmly onto the runway. During the crew debrief the Captain and I both agreed that the safe outcome of the landing was not in question; but had the aircraft floated longer; we were prepared to execute a go-around. Runway 26 was initially assigned then closed and we were switched to a shorter runway.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
724,724,724,724,7984,I arrived at the hangar to reposition [the aircraft] for refueling followed by a maintenance test flight. The aircraft (A/C) was pulled out of the hangar and a preflight inspection was completed with no anomalies found except for the emergency air being on the low end of the green range (1900lbs). The A/C was taxied to where the refueling was preformed. Following refueling; the emergency air was serviced by maintenance personnel. Just prior to entering the A/C for the test flight my co-pilot performed a walk around with no anomalies found.Engine start and taxi to the active runway were uneventful. During takeoff with the co-pilot at the controls; approximately 3-5 seconds after rotation the right avionics cowl cover dislodged and was stuck perpendicular across both windows. I took the controls and instructed the co-pilot to declare an emergency and request landing on runway 7R. We decided to leave the A/C configuration as it was (flaps 8 gear down) and make a flaps 8 landing so as not to change the airflow over the cowl in case it were to depart the A/C further and damage either an engine or tail component. Once this decision was made we verified 'Flaps 8; Gear Down; 3 Green' and verified hydraulic pressure Followed by a Vref speeds to be flow for flaps 8 (Vref +20). The remainder of the approach and landing was made uneventfully. The cowling fell from the window just as we were coming to a stop on the runway. As the cowl slid off the left side window brakes we fully applied to avoid contact [by] the left main tires; however the A/C didn't stop in time and the cowl was run over by the left main. We continued our taxi into the ramp and the A/C was parked and secured followed by a phone call to Ops Control to advise of the situation.The mechanic that serviced the emergency air (located in the right avionics bay) stated that he had forgotten to tighten the fasteners for the right avionics cowl after removing it to service the emergency air.

725,725,725,725,9003,After being cleared to line up and wait by ATC behind a departing 747; we started slowly moving toward the runway after the 747 was already on the roll. As the departing traffic was a considerable ways into his take off; we had just passed the hold short line. At that point; we felt the right side of the aircraft begin to lift and the aircraft began to roll to the left. It is difficult to say how much the airplane rolled left but was very defined. After about 2 seconds; the airplane returned to its normal level position on the ground. At this point; we decided not to attempt take off and a taxi off the runway. We requested this with ATC and advised them of our wake encounter. After taxiing off the runway; we decided the best course of action was to return to the gate and have Maintenance inspect the airplane; even though we felt there was no wingtip contact or any other damage. While the Captain was coordinating with ground; I was talking to operations and Maintenance advising them of our situation and that we requested a gate and Maintenance to come look at the airplane. Upon returning to the gate; the aircraft was inspected and cleared. We departed the gate again and the flight went as planned. The wake  of the 747 and high; shifting winds; (gusting 35kts plus) I believe caused the encounter. We were just crossing the hold short line not directly behind the departing aircraft when we started to roll and had given what seemed like adequate time and distance for the wake to dissipate and become a non-issue.

After landing; the aircraft was not well controlled on the rollout and I exited on the left side of the runway instead of proceeding further down the runway and exiting on the right side. Upon exiting the runway towards a grassy area; the aircraft crossed the runway edge lights and the propeller struck one of the ground lights. The aircraft was taxied back to the hangar and upon inspection it was clear that damage had occurred to one of the two composite propeller blades.

The ground around the runway was very uneven due to recent construction caused by heavy truck tire divots. I brought the plane to a halt by pulling the fuel lever; stopping the engine; and braking action. The aircraft came to a rest about 300 feet from the runway. No injuries occurred and only damage to aircraft was minor to right main gear and right aileron. One of the three hinges broke and bent the aileron; cracking it.

As the FO in the right seat I had my head turned to the right clearing the area where we were about to taxi. Shortly after starting our forward movement I felt the airplane shudder and we immediately applied our brakes and came to a stop. After a short discussion with ground personnel it was determined we struck a parked B737 parked at [the adjacent] gate. The flight attendants reported smelling a fuel smell in the cabin shortly after we came to a stop. We notified Ground Control and requested the fire department investigate the fuel smell and examine the aircraft exterior.

After [advising ATC] I started on the emergency checklist. We asked ATC for the nearest suitable airport which was Airport ZZZ1 which was paved and had over 5000 FT of runway. The flight attendant called shortly after that as the lavatory smoke detector started sounding. We talked as best we could and I advised her we would be landing within a few minutes and also made a PA we would be evacuating when we touched down. I called back but she was fighting the fire and someone else picked up the phone and I decided to continue calls over the PA and land.We asked for fire and rescue and ATC advised fire and rescue were being dispatched to the airport. We had the weather for ZZZ already and determined the best runway would be RWY XY. We were high and started a left 360 to lose altitude.

731,731,731,731,6256,My student was a twenty-nine year old Egyptian native who had been living in the United States for the past year. He recently earned his commercial pilot rating from a local Flight School; and was receiving his CFI training from me. He and I had recently completed the ground training portion of the CFI training (minus the FOI's) and had just begun the flight training. His ground knowledge was very weak; so I planned to repeat that portion of his training; with him teaching me the material more. After three flights in a 172RG; talking through and practicing commercial maneuvers; he had made great improvement. Because he was a CFI candidate; the flights were done with the student in the right seat. On our fourth flight; I planned to practice landings with him continuing in right seat. The 172RG was a new plane for him; as he had done his flight training in a Piper Arrow. My plan was to take him to a nearby quiet airport; with a huge runway; as our local airport had a lot of traffic and was notorious for crosswinds. The student however expressed a strong desire to practice crosswinds; having not done so with his previous flight school training. I reasoned; based on his commercial rating; he would have the ability to learn crosswind landings. In the three flights previous; we had done full stop landings all of which required my crosswind corrections. The fourth flight was to stay in the pattern and practice landings. On several occasions prior to the flight; I discussed proper correction technique and again right before takeoff in the run-up. I had just finished emphasizing the importance of letting off your rudder correction immediately after touchdown; to avoid causing the plane to turn in the direction of the rudder correction. I also said if he started to become unstable on the runway to let off the rudders and the plane will straighten itself out. And; that only after the plane had stabilized; to ease in some rudder correction to get back on centerline and to stay off of the brakes until the plane had slowed down on its own. I also emphasized this from a CFI perspective; cautioning him to watch out for this in his own future students. For the first landing in the pattern; the student did exactly what I had warned him of. We had a slight left crosswind approximately 6-7 knots; landing Runway 28 with winds from 230-250. We had a slight amount of left aileron correction; as well as a slight amount of right rudder correction. We had a stable approach and flare; however; immediately after touchdown; the plane veered right and then hard left towards the edge of the left side of the runway. Three times I sternly told him to get 'off the rudders; off the brakes; my controls!' At the edge of the runway; I was able to regain control and prevent the plane from going off the runway. As I was taxiing the plane off the runway; Tower Control asked if we needed any assistance. I responded none was required; but requested a taxi clearance to transient parking. After reaching transient parking; I shut down the plane and got out. I inspected the tires and nose gear. I checked the gear and rolled the plane forward and backward to check for any bald spots. I then got back into the plane to discuss what had just happened. I told him he had not released his right rudder correction on touchdown; causing us to veer right and that he had over corrected with left rudder and brake; causing us to veer left. We discussed the problem of him not relinquishing the flight controls and he agreed that he would let off right away the next time I told him 'my controls'. He nodded his head and said he understood that he needed to stay off the rudders and brakes right after touchdown; and to be really light on his rudder corrections. We started the plane back up and I told the student that I wanted to show him a landing and wanted him to shadow the controls with me. I was on the controls when we landed for the second time together in the pattern; and we landed stabilized with a light crosswind with no problems. Coming back around for our third landing; I gave him back the controls. We had a stabilized approach and landing; and this time there was no problem with rudder control. I did however; have to help the student with the aileron correction because he was letting out the correction on the flare. This is very common when learning crosswind landings; so I was holding just enough pressure on the controls to prevent him from taking out the left aileron correction. We made two more landings; working out that same problem with the aileron correction; but no problems with rudder control. The other problem the student had on two of his landings was that he was not reducing power to idle. Twice; I had to pull out the power for him and remind him to bring it out all the way.On the fifth touch and go; we came in on a stabilized approach with just the right amount of left aileron and right rudder correction. We flared and as soon as we touched down; the plane veered hard to the right and then hard to the left; putting us almost at a 90 degree angle to the runway. We started to skid across the runway towards the left edge. Again I told him to get off the rudders and brake; my controls while trying to overpower him with some right rudder and a little right brake. At this point it was like being on ice and any type of correction might make it worse. I was able to stop the skidding sideways motion and bring the plane back to the right just before going off the edge of the runway. As the plane came back around to the right; the input of both rudders and brake; as well as our forward momentum; caused us to pitch forward; which in turn caused a prop strike. The prop strike caused us to pitch back level and then the plane continued off the edge of the left side of the runway into the grass. I proceeded taxiing the plane out of the grass to the taxiway. Tower again asked if we needed assistance and I said no; but that we needed a taxi clearance to the maintenance shop. I told the student that we had just had a prop strike; and he did not think the plane had been damaged. Lack of experience and gaps in his flight training; in my opinion; lead to the cause of this incident. He did not have enough experience with crosswind landings; and at his level; he should have been proficient. More training at airfields with crosswinds would have prevented this. The student trained primarily at a field that does not experience a lot of crosswinds. A commercial rated pilot should know how to land with crosswinds; and should never have a problem with over correcting with brake and rudder control right after landing.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
732,732,732,732,5549,Aircraft X- [A319]; was docked in hangar bay and mechanics were connecting ground power cable after cleaners boarded. Grounding cable was attached to Left Hand (LH) Main Landing Gear (MLG) and floor ground point. Maintenance Manager Tech was in flight deck and as another tech switched on power at the wall panel an arc with heavy smoke was noted at LH MLG area accompanied by smoke that filled the bay. The Tech at wall switch killed ground power as all personnel aboard evacuated.Facility staff were summoned to investigate ground power anomaly and check the ground power cord for arcing; loss of ground circuit. A write-up was created summarizing the event and was worked by an [technician] who conducted troubleshooting. The aircraft Ground Power Control Unit was replaced and all operational testing determined no faults. The hangar ground power cord was replaced and the removed cable examined; cut for inspection then tested by [technical] staff with no faults found. The aircraft was then released to service with the approval of Maintenance Control after a short investigation into the matter. Statements from all involved were obtained by Operation Manager and Foreman.The nature of this serious unheard of event is concerning. The high voltage current traveling through the air frame to ground with no known cause should be investigated to the fullest. The Airbus Ground Power Control Unit should be subject to a tear-down to determine if an internal defect occurred that allowed current to short to the air frame. The grounding cable coil fused to itself with insulator melted off completely. One theory is that the ground power cable was inserted 180 degrees in reverse but that seems very unlikely. This event should be the subject of an Alert Bulletin for all Airbus operators and ground handlers! If an unlucky person was handling this cable during this event they would have been injured or killed from the current or at minimum burned by the arc flash.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

While we were going out of the Bay-Y door; myself [as Maintenance Supervisor] and Mechanic X were almost crushed when the Bay-Y door was commanded 'Open' [in order] to move the tug to the aircraft that had just pulled in. This is standard operations down here [at ZZZ].  We all go out to help tow our Routine Overnight (RON) aircraft into its assigned Hangar Bay.

The discrepancy has been brought to the attention of my upper Management team; but the problem never seems to duplicate when it's checked out. I do not believe this is any one person's fault. The Hangar doors need to be fixed to avoid possible future injury. I did push Mechanic X out of the way and injury was avoided in this instance.

736,736,736,736,8762,I was preparing for departure in my C182. There was a regional jet ahead of me at the hold short line; a [commercial carrier] jet waiting to cross [the runway] toward the terminal; and a Cessna 210 on final approach. All three of these pilots had announced their presence and declared their intentions. The 210 landed without incident.  The regional jet lined up and departed without incident. The [commercial carrier] jet then crossed the runway towards the terminal and I announced on [the common traffic frequency] my intention to 'take Runway XX for immediate departure;' looked for landing traffic; and lined up for departure; all without incident. There appeared to be no other active traffic on the ground or in the air as there was no reply or other declaration of intentions on [the common traffic frequency]. Once the [commercial carrier] jet had cleared the runway; I started my takeoff roll. As I approached rotation speed I noticed another [commercial carrier] jet approaching the runway from the terminal area at what appeared to be a very slow speed. I held back on the power to allow options and soon realized that this jet had no intention of holding short of the runway and immediately entered the runway. I immediately determined that it would be impossible/inadvisable to attempt this departure over the [commercial carrier] jet.  Fortunately; I was able to chop the power and swerve behind the [commercial carrier] jet as it crossed. As you may imagine; the C182 is not designed to rapidly change direction at high speed on the ground. The swerve and the exhaust from the jet engines made the maneuver anything but routine. Immediately after crossing behind the [commercial carrier] jet; I keyed the mic and stated 'Thank you [carrier name].' There was no answer from the crew of the [commercial carrier] jet and it continued to [another runway] and immediately departed without ever acknowledging the event.

748,748,748,748,646,Upon return from a one hour training flight; the student pilot set up for a gusty wind landing on Runway 14; configured the C172 with 20 degrees of flaps and established a final approach speed of 70-75 KTS. Initial round out and flare was normal. As the aircraft slowed; the student pilot allowed the aircraft to 'weather vane' into the wind (180@12G24KTS). The CFI noted this to the student pilot with verbal cues and hand gestures. During the flare; the student pilot allowed the aircraft to balloon slightly (approximately 4-5' above the runway) as he strived to input crosswind corrections with the rudder and ailerons. The gusting wind suddenly 'died away' causing the aircraft to suddenly sink toward the runway. The student pilot corrected for this by swiftly applying excessive back yoke causing the nose to rise sharply and the tail tie-down ring to strike the runway surface causing the tail tie-down ring to shear off and the plastic rudder fairing (bottom) to crack. The aluminum skin around the tail tie-down ring was scratched (an area approx 2' X 2' square). The roll out and taxi was normal. The CFI (me) failed to intervene fast enough to prevent the tail from striking the runway. There were no passengers on board and neither the student nor the CFI was injured. I believe this situation could have been prevented if the CFI had kept his hands closer to the yoke given the gusty conditions and intervened earlier when the student began showing signs of getting behind the aircraft. Also; we could have requested Runway 19 (more in line with the existing winds) and removed the crosswind from the equation.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

750,750,750,750,6056,After an unscheduled aircraft swap; ground operations was rushed due to moving baggage for passengers to the unscheduled aircraft. Additionally; due to the lack of cabin bag storage; ground personnel were rushed to load 11 gate-checked bags at push; about 30 minutes late.The push started uneventfully; but as we were clearing the safety zone; the tug driver yelled 'Set the brake! Set the brake! Set the brake!' As there was no preface to the call; and Ground was talking constantly; I initially didn't know he was talking to me. Of note; we were using the wireless communication set. If you fly at all; you know that the volume output by these units to the cockpit is totally insufficient. I usually have to position the volume knob to three o'clock or higher just to hear the tug driver; and if the First Officer speaks on the intercom; or ground is speaking; the tug is nearly impossible to hear. I announced I was setting the brakes in case the call wasn't from my guy; and despite trying to be gentle on the brakes; the aircraft still reared nose up and shuttered to a stop. I guess braking an aircraft while backing up requires an entirely different technique than one moving forward. The tow bar had released from the nose gear connection point and the aircraft was moving all on its own. Thank goodness we weren't in a [longer aircraft]. It could have stood it on its tail.Points of note:- [Airport] was doing cascading aircraft swaps due to a dent written up on one aircraft. I thought that our policy was to keep the crew with the aircraft they broke in order to only inconvenience the passengers on that aircraft rather than every passenger flying through [this airport]. Unscheduled swaps kill the ramp agents.- The wireless communication sets are impossible to hear without nearly maxing the ACP volume. Still normal volume on other channels is louder than wireless. Secondly; and anecdotally at least twice on each four day; some ramp agent has to run and find another set as the wireless is unreliable.- ('Set the brakes') three times with no preface on the lowest volume channel causes confusion. We weren't sure we were being called; but felt we needed to stop in case we were about to hit something or someone. The urgency and tenor of the voice demanded immediate action.- Flight attendants were up briefing for departure. Once the brakes were set; I interrupted them to inquire about their condition. The A thought the B may have hurt herself. I asked her to find out for sure. No injuries; thankfully.- If ramp agents are trained for a loose aircraft scenario; calm communication such as 'Captain; the tow bar has come loose. Please set the brakes' or 'Captain; stop for a truck' would create a shared mental model. Not knowing if someone has walked behind the aircraft; or even that the tug is no longer hooked up can lead to injuries or damage to the aircraft.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

754,754,754,754,3737,As we were cruising to CHA; the Captain began to get the weather for CHA. Since we were running late due to storms earlier in the day the Tower closed before we reached the airport. I then pulled the weather up again just to double check the NOTAMs that are placed on the recording when the Tower shuts down. The weather was the same. 10SM visibility and there was a BKN layer; but it was above our altitude. The NOTAMs had changed saying that Runway 2-20 was closed; but Runway 15-33 was open and that they had set the lighting to medium intensity. We both listened to this several times making sure that we were hearing it correctly. We continued into the airport and set up for the visual to 33 with a GPS back up. We were talking to Atlanta Center at the time and we picked up the beacon and the PAPI lights so we were cleared for the visual approach. As we got closer to the runway; we discovered that we could not see the actual runway surface. We then tried to activate lighting via Pilot Controlled Lighting just hoping that it might work since this runway does not have Pilot Controlled Lighting. We then decided to go-around since the lights weren't coming on. As I made a turn to re-enter the downwind; I noticed that Runway 2-20 lights were on and were either set to medium or high intensity. We got back on with Atlanta Center and ask him if Chattanooga mentioned anything to him about the conditions of the lighting. He said they had done that the past couple nights and that Runway 2-20 was closed. I then made a turn towards the northeast thinking that we would either be going back or to a diversion airport. The Captain was messaging Dispatch and they asked if we could make it back; but we did not have the fuel to return. They say go to ZZZ; so we changed our destination to ZZZ. Atlanta gave us a clearance and we continued. Dispatch messaged again saying they can't reach anyone at ZZZ Operations and ask if we could go to ZZZ1; but we did not have the fuel for that either. We continued on to ZZZ. Once we arrived; rampers were waiting for us and we get waved in. Captain got on phone with Dispatch and the decision came that the passengers will be bused to CHA and we REPO'd. I believe that this event occurred due to Tower either forgetting to turn on the Runway 15-33 lights or accidentally turned on Runway 2-20 out of habit since we saw the lights on for that runway. I am not sure if Runway 2-20 lights came on when we tried to activate lights for Runway 15-33 or if they were on the entire time though. But since the NOTAMs on the weather report said that Runway 2-20 was closed we could not land on it.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
755,755,755,755,7909,I was the PIC and the flying pilot. I started the engines and called for the after start check list. I performed a 'thru flight' flight control check and everything felt normal (no binding or resistance issues) and the control forces seemed normally loaded. A takeoff brief was given and the taxi checklist was performed. Once take off clearance was given; we performed a line up checklist and I lined the aircraft up in position on runway 25. I advanced the throttle thru 1.25 EPR and engaged the auto-throttles; released the brakes and began the takeoff roll. At approximately 70-80 knots; I heard an audible 3 bong warning and saw the red master caution warning light illuminate. I immediately called the abort and pulled the throttles to idle. A light amount of braking pressure was applied. We coasted to the end of the runway and exited [the runway]. My Copilot and I discussed possible causes for the warning and both agreed that we did not see any CASS message to help us determine the probable cause. My Copilot pulled up the exceedance page and we agreed there was no exceedance recorded. I then asked my copilot to check the circuit breakers in the cockpit for any that may have tripped. His cursory inspection did not reveal any tripped circuit breakers. We then discussed what I thought may have been the cause and suggested that perhaps we had an LP exceedance. I believed it was in fact the cause; and we elected to return for another takeoff attempt. I briefed my Copilot that I would set the takeoff power manually. We performed another lineup checklist and were cleared for takeoff. I lined up the airplane on runway 25 and firmly held the brakes while I advanced the throttles to takeoff power; my copilot verified that takeoff power was set and I released the brakes. We accelerated through 70-80 knots when again we had the three bong and master caution warning; I quickly looked at the engine instrument and observed that the LP [engine Low Pressure bleed] had gone into the yellow arc and reduced the power slightly back into the white arc. We continued accelerating through V1 and then at Vr I attempted to rotate the nose up. As I pulled back on the yoke; the flight controls did not respond normally to my input. The controls had no noticeable pressure resistance and felt unloaded with hydraulic pressure. I moved the yoke forward and then back further aft and still had the same result. I immediately told my copilot I had no flight controls and began the abort. I pulled the throttles to idle and applied maximum braking and then initiated full reverse thrust and called for speed brakes. Once aircraft was at a slow speed we advised tower of our rejected takeoff and proceeded to exit runway and brought the plane to a stop on taxiway 'A' facing east and shut down both engines. We had very hot brakes and they should approach with caution. The Incident Commander then came over the radio and advised that there was smoke rising from the right main landing gear. I then asked my copilot to contact FBO and organize a tug to tow us. While we were doing this the Incident Commander stated 'Captain; evacuate the aircraft now; you have a fire on the right landing gear'. The copilot and I both jumped out of the seat and I instructed passengers to evacuate the aircraft now while copilot cleared and opened the main cabin door. Once the passengers and copilot were off the airplane; I exited and advised the responders that the aircraft was clear and everyone was off. The passengers were escorted to a waiting van and were taken back to the FBO. My Copilot and I were both instructed by Incident Commander to sit in his truck while they initiated fire suppression.

756,756,756,756,2509,Aircraft was taxiing into gate with a new Marshaller directing this operation. The PIC stopped the aircraft 5 feet short of the stop mark. The Marshaller attempted to get the PIC to move the aircraft forward with his wands but one of the engines was shut down as soon as the aircraft came to a stop. As ground power was being applied; I moved the tow tractor into position and hooked up the tow bar and interphone cable.I attempted many times to contact flight crew interphone and crew call button but was not successful. Exited tractor to make 'eye contact' with flight crew and to motion to release brakes. Once the brakes were released I started to tow the aircraft into the proper location when the plane came to a stop. I thought that I was up against the edge of the concrete parking pad and attempted to keep pulling forward when the shear bolts on the tow bar failed. I immediately stopped the tow tractor and by this time the flight crew was on the interphone wanting to know what the noise was and was anything damaged. I inspected the nose gear and wheel well for damage - none was found. The only damage was to the shear bolts on the tow bar. The PIC stated that he thought the aircraft was rolling on its own and reapplied the brakes. When the flight crew was leaving the plane; the First Officer was the first off the plane and stated that he was having difficulty operating the interphone; (understanding how to use it?) As the Captain was leaving he stated again that he thought the aircraft was rolling away and set the parking brake. I stated to him that I had tried multiple times to contact him with the interphone and crew call button but he said he neither heard the chime nor saw the light. Once the flight crew had left; I function checked the crew call system and found it only worked part of the time. Excessive force was required to get the crew call button to work. Cause: A lack of continuous contact via the interphone with the flight crew during the attempted aircraft move. When I motioned for the PIC to release the parking brake; he thought this was for the down-loading of the aircraft and not for the movement of the aircraft. Possible difficulty of the flight crew was having with the interphone operation. Maybe have the flight crew leave the engines running for a few seconds after Marshaller stops them incase the Marshaller needs to have them move some more.

757,757,757,757,8221,We got our clearance to push back from [the gate] and established contact with the ground crew as we always do. As the pushback commenced; we were given clearance to start Engine 1. Engine 1 was still spooling up when I was told to set brakes. Our nose was extremely close to the non-movement area and was titled towards the NW direction. I inquired the tug driver if that is where we normally get pushed to. The reason for this inquiry was because there were fuel trucks and service vehicles ahead and to our 9-10 o'clock position and within close proximity in the non-movement area; and knowing that we would have to make a turn in the southerly direction initially to taxi to our runway; I wanted to know if we could get pushed further back. It was at this point that we heard the tug driver yell on the radio; 'Set the Brake; you're rolling up on us'. At first; the call did not make any sense at all. I believe I asked him to say again. Then [the] First Officer and I both heard a grinding noise and could feel the airplane moving. My initial thought was that the tug was malfunctioning and that it was dragging the airplane along with it. It was hard to tell but it felt as if there was resistance and vibration along with the grinding noise. The tug driver called again saying 'set the brake'. My feet were already close to the brake pedals and I immediately applied steady pressure and brought the airplane to a stop. At this time; once the aircraft had been brought to a complete stop with the brake pedals; I did engage the Parking brake handle. I asked the tug driver what had just occurred. He told me that he had instructed me to set the brakes and that because I didn't; the aircraft was rolling towards him. This did not make any sense to me. We have procedures in place that prevent an airplane from rolling prematurely. This being that the tug is usually connected until authorized to disconnect. I employed the same practices I do every day when I push back and that is that I never authorize a disconnect until the airplane gets a normal stabilized start from Engine 1. This is something I've always done. I asked the tug driver again to explain what had happened and that is when he finally confessed that his crew member had prematurely disconnected the tug. This was done WITHOUT any authorization by me. This was extremely unsafe and violates all our procedures in place. The Parking Brake was NOT set; and even though Engine 1 had not fully started; it was producing thrust which is why the airplane started rolling forward towards the tug bar and vehicle. I asked the tug driver what the noise was and if the tug had impacted the nose wheel assembly. He replied that the tow bar only impacted the tires and that they had inspected it and 'we were good to go'. This was certainly not something the F/O and I were going to take gently. Sitting up in the cockpit; we had no idea what the extent of the damage was below. I looked over to the right and saw 2 aircraft on the taxiway waiting for us. We both decided it would be best to return to the gate and have a thorough maintenance inspection of the nose wheel/strut assembly. As we were pulling in; we communicated with our flight attendants explaining the situation. They said along with all the passengers they felt the aircraft jerking and heard the noise. After getting the jet bridge connected; I made a PA from the cabin explaining the situation to the passengers. They were understating of the situation. I then spoke to the Station manager and called Maintenance Control. Both F/O and I went down to look at the airplane. The grinding noise seems to have been the tow bar impacting the nose wheel tire and rims. We could not find any damage to the nose wheel strut assembly thankfully so. We spoke to the ground crew and at first they apologized; but what really struck us as odd was their lack of remorse or concern. They were engaging in jokes and not the least bit concerned about the potentially dangerous predicament they had put themselves and us as pilots responsible for. It was extremely shocking. Maintenance looked over the tires with the First Officer and I. We pointed out the rim shavings and tire scuff marks from the contact. He then sent pictures to the controller and they determined that the best course of action was to replace both nose wheel tires. We were completely fine with that Decision. I advised the station manager and our dispatcher and the decision to deplane was made; because the airplane had to be lifted off the ground. I made another PA and passengers were understanding. Maintenance started working on the tire replacements. It must be mentioned that we had another issue present itself with the ground crew while we waited for the tire change. Earlier we were given a load report indicating a bag count of +72 bags. Immediately this was an alarming number and so we asked if it was below the line; to which we got a very reassuring yes and a response that stated that they packed them in very efficiently. F/O asked if he should go down there to check but by the time we finished our checklists; we had barely 2 mins to close and get out on time. I told him that I would reconfirm with the ground crew over the radio. I did and we got another very reassuring yes. While we were on the ramp; the FWD baggage compartment had to [be] opened for an aisle chair. We took the opportunity to look inside and to our dismay we found bags packed to the ceiling. There were at least 3 bags blatantly over the fire suppression line. When shown the bags; the individual (same person as the tug driver) who wouldn't give us his name got extremely confrontational with us. He told us 'Don't understand why it's such a big deal'. I took the time to explain to him the severity of that line and that by defying it; he takes away our only fighting chance of a fire in the air. He honestly did not seem concerned in the least bit. He was more upset that he may have to move bags. I told him to immediately move bags to the rear if he needs to but we won't be pushing back with bags above the fire line. At this point; he got even more heated. His Manager came out and talked with us. He seemed to be more civil. He said that it has been a hot topic and that he will discuss it with his guys. The tire change took approx. 45 minutes. I went up and made a gate announcement with the good news and we started re-boarding. Paperwork was completed in the logbook; doors closed; and we pushed back once again. Total delay was 2:01. Flight continued without incident or issues. Simply put this incident was due to gross negligence by the ground crew who blatantly disobeyed procedures and practices put in place to avoid this exact scenario. It was dangerous; unsafe; time consuming; stressful; and costly to the airline. This sort of haphazard behavior should not be encouraged nor tolerated when dealing with such heavy machinery. The ground crew put themselves in danger and put both F/O and I in a very compromising situation. The worst part is there was no remorse whatsoever even when we explained the severity of the issues to them in great detail.

759,759,759,759,7613,While pulling into ZZZ Gate XX; we observed Company Ramp vehicles (baggage carts being towed; tugs; etc.) driving at excessive speeds as they drove through the 'under the terminal tunnel' road; then in front of our jet; past our jet; and onto their various destinations.  I realize that we need to keep the operation moving. However; whenever a vehicle passes at high speed near or through a 'Safety zone' where Ramp Agents; Pilots; Maintenance Technicians; and Fuelers are preflighting; loading; fueling; working; walking; or standing; that high speed vehicle presents a potential hazard to the pedestrian. It becomes even more hazardous at night when the high speed vehicles passes in close proximity to a stationary vehicle; baggage loader; fueling station; etc. where an unsuspecting pedestrian (not expecting to merge with a passing vehicle) may inadvertently walk out in front of the unseen high speed vehicle.  With hearing protection; the pedestrian may not even hear the vehicle coming.1. I recommend that the Ramp vehicles slow down whenever they pass in or near the Safety zone where pedestrians are likely doing their jobs.2. Since the road passes directly under the terminal and exits onto the ramp directly in front of ZZZ Gate XX; there is no way for the vehicles to avoid the high-density pedestrian area in and around ZZZ Gate XX.  Placing a speed bump in the road and placing a 'slow down; watch for pedestrian' sign may assist in preventing a collision between a motor vehicle and a person.  3. Ramp Agents wearing reflective tape vests will assist in making them more visible at night.4. Make sure lights on the vehicle are operational and turned on.  5.

767,767,767,767,9438,We were operating a morning first flight of day. The aircraft was put on a hardstand with no tug where with guidance from the ramp crew we would be able to start both engines and be directed to the movement area of the ramp. After completing the Engine Start Check; I looked over to the Ramper and with their permission; I released the parking brake. I however; did not reengage the parking brake. I then directed the First Officer to start both engines. The number 2 engine was started first. Following the start of the number 1 engine; the First Officer stepped on the brakes and simultaneously engaged the parking brake. This caused the airplane to stop abruptly. I asked the First Officer why he did what he did; and he said that we were moving. I then said that it was my mistake for not having the parking brake engaged; but we were moving slowly and we were far from any equipment and people. I then asked the First Officer two questions Why did he not say to me that the aircraft was moving and I would have applied the brakes and why did he apply both the brakes and the parking brake at the same time ? He said that he was not sure the brakes alone would have stopped the airplane. We then proceeded with the rest of the normal checklists and taxied to the runway and departed. In flight; the Flight Attendant said she was injured from the whiplash and was bruised. She said she may see a doctor upon reaching our destination. At the end of the flight I exchanged my contact information with the Flight Attendant to keep me informed of her physical condition. The whole sequence of events started with me not engaging the parking brake after releasing it for the out time. The threat of not recognizing that we do not have rampers to tell us to reset the brake after push was not addressed during our threat discussion and mitigation. My error was not seeing the airplane moving after the number one engine started and stopping the airplane before the First Officer. The undesired state was the fact that the aircraft moved when it should not have causing potential harm to the ramp crew and outside equipment. The other error I would say was CRM. The First Officer acted in the interest of safety and was the first to recognize the movement of the aircraft. He however over reacted. Based on the fact the airplane was moving slowly and we were far from rampers and equipment; I think he should have told me that we were moving and I would have stopped the airplane. If I did not react he then should have stepped on the brakes. This was the error on CRM our part. After talking to him I found out that he just finished IOE recently and this was his first trip after completing IOE. I think lack of experience in actual line operations caused him to act the way he did. I also should have checked with the Flight Attendant to see how she was doing after the airplane came to a stop. What I learned was to be extra vigilant when you are taxiing out with no towbar from the gate. If we were close to people or equipment; this could have been bad. Addressing ramp operations with no tug driver telling you to 'set the brake' is a threat that we should have discussed and talked about. I also need to be more aware of aircraft (unintentional) movement in all situations and react appropriately.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

When I got onto the airplane and briefed with my crew we discussed that the plane is a little warm and we hadn't been catered yet and and it's better to let the passengers be in the terminal for 10 more minutes so when the agent came down to ask if we were ready I asked her if we could board at 30 or even 35 prior to departure so the passengers weren't stuck on a hot plane for longer than they had too. She agreed. The agent then came down and informed me that they had called the inflight supervisor and she told them they needed to board on time. During boarding the supervisor showed up to the plane and I told her my reasoning for wanting to wait that having the passengers sit and wait on the plane was not as comfortable or safe as letting them be in the terminal where they can freely use the restroom and be comfortable; she informed me that on time departures and the agents rubric of time was very important and that we needed to stick to that and that at [time] the pilots had already landed. She also informed me that the agents told her we wanted to wait for the pilots to arrive to board which was not the case and when the agent came down she apologized for not being able to wait and told me she did not tell them we wanted to wait until pilots arrived. The agent was done boarding the plane at 20 min prior to departure. The plane was so hot we sent the last passenger a commuting pilot up to the agents to inform them that it was too hot on the plane.

779,779,779,779,4130,During my pre-flight at the gate; I noticed that the cargo loading and ground crew was wearing 'Worldwide' safety vests instead of our Company. I observed no Company supervisors on the ramp. The ground crew was not ready for departure at departure time. They used non-standard phraseology during the pre-departure; push back; engine start and disconnect process. The ground crew opened the forward cargo door twice after the parking brake was released for push back without first notifying the Captain. The Captain flew to our destination and other than noting that the aircraft was nose heavy on takeoff; the flight was uneventful. After we parked at gate the Crew Chief entered the cockpit as the passengers were deplaning. He explained that the cargo had been incorrectly loaded and pointed to his 'Offload Report.' The report clearly showed that only ONE bag should have been placed in the forward cargo and the rest should have been in the aft cargo. The Crew Chief reported that the aft cargo was empty and ALL the bags were in the forward cargo. Obviously this is a very serious issue - one which could have caused aircraft controllability issues; or worse; a hull loss. The ground crew for our flight was one of the Company's recently outsourced crews. They used non-standard phraseology; indicating a lack of proper training. They were unable to prepare the aircraft for departure in a timely manner in spite of the fact that the cargo was relatively light; needing only one cargo bay. In my opinion; this lack of training; experience and supervision resulted in a very dangerous cargo loading error.Better training and supervision of new; improved outsourced contractors.

She was able to get out the words 'Diabetic'. I told her I would call a medical. I called the flight crew and said we have a medical; I'll get back to you. Now I ask for a doctor on board. The passenger in 1A quickly said 'Yes what's the problem.' Me '13B Diabetic.' He went immediately to her.Another passenger closer to her had gotten up to help and he came back to me relaying the doctor's orders. Orange juice and water. I sent this by him and called the flight crew back to give all the information. Flight crew relayed info to Operations. Within minutes the passenger had come back around and after an additional 10-15 minutes was given the OK; by the doctor; to fly. I asked her if she wanted to continue to ZZZ and she said yes. I could see she was in full possession of her faculties and with the doctor's OK only if we take off immediately.The doctor confirmed that this episode was a direct result of sitting in an overly hot aircraft for an extended amount of time with no air conditioning. I relayed the information to the flight crew and the Captain said he would relay the information to Operations because we were in a very long line for take-off and would see if we could get a medical clearance to go ahead. This was obtained and we did move out in front of the long line and took off. I checked on my passenger in 13B many times during the very turbulent flight and she was doing well. I passed out can drinks to everyone on board to help with the thirst and overheating that we all had gone through. I used the can drinks because of the turbulence and this was safer than having an open bottle of water in my arms that could have gone awry. The full cause of this incident was a deferred APU on a CRJ200. This happens way too often with no thought for the passengers and crew on board.

783,783,783,783,7849,First Officer was flying. After V1 (Takeoff Decision Speed) upon rotation I felt a slight side to side vibration which continued after rotation and then stopped.  There was a heavy aircraft that departed right before us; I was debating that if it was the wake turbulence since it continued after rotation. Before retracting Gear BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) was also normal. As a precaution I kept thinking if it could be one of our tires; I talked to my FO (First Officer) and discussed landing with a precaution and briefed using longest runway available; use of thrust reversers and not braking hard just in case if  there is an issue with the tire. In the meantime; there was no complaint from both the flight attendants or any passengers about any abnormality or noise. Runway XXR was favoring our landing and was appropriate for our landing and wind direction. First Officer greased the landing but we both felt the same vibration we had upon rotation; we brought the aircraft to a safe stop then exited the runway and slowly taxied to [the gate at our destination]; brake temperatures were 1121. After deplaning passengers; me and First Officer went for a post walk with our flashlights and discovered the reason for vibration; outboard right main landing gear almost half of the tire rubber was missing. Noticed scuff marks on the flap fairing and top of the inboard flap. I came back and contacted Dispatch and asked to inform [our origin airport] for possible tire tread on the runway while I was talking to Dispatch; First Officer also contacted [the destination's] Tower to inform them of possible debris on the runway. Tire in question held pressure and was inflated with missing rubber. I would like to mention that as a crew that night we had a great CRM (Crew Resource Management) and were well prepared. It was our first flight on that aircraft that night.I think in any abnormal situation crew is tested and that night with discussion and agreement with reason; we both chose the most safest outcome to bring the passenger; crew and aircraft to the safety as normal as possible. I also asked the flight attendants after landing if they heard any noise or felt any vibration or if any passengers that were sitting on that side of the tire said anything to them; the both said they did not feel or heard anything.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
784,784,784,784,5370,I was flying from ZZZ1 to ZZZ. I got a weather update while refueling in ZZZ1. When we were about 10 mins before landing; I called the Tower and asked about runway conditions. The Tower told me that within the previous 15 mins a landing aircraft reported braking good. The controller reported the runway braking 5-5-5. I touched down on Runway 10 about 300 feet from the approach end. Initial braking was fair to good. About 2/3 of the way down the runway we were below 40 knots; I was applying full braking with some effect. As we approached the end of the runway we were slow enough that I felt I could turn onto the taxiway. The aircraft turned toward the taxiway; but the direction of travel did not change. We slid through a small bank of snow off the end of the pavement and came to rest with the aircraft perpendicular to the runway centerline; nose to the right; with the right main landing gear about 8 feet from the pavement. There was no damage; and no injuries.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
785,785,785,785,2196,While landing; after being cleared to land at ZZZ on Runway XXR; the aircraft departed the right edge of the runway just northeast of Taxiway X; at about a 30 degree to 45 degree angle; on the ground and upright after the right wing temporarily lifted up to an approximately 20 degree to 30 degree angle. It rolled across the grass between Runway XXR and the parallel taxiway; where the aircraft came to rest in a normal; upright attitude and on an approximate heading of 070 degrees. Between the time the aircraft began to depart the runway and the time it came to rest; I felt the impact of the aircraft hitting something. I'm not sure what the aircraft hit; but I think it was a runway light.While on Taxiway Y; the Tower instructed me to 'make a 180;' which I did. I then requested a taxi clearance back to [hangar] which I received and executed. The aircraft taxied normally. When I arrived back at the hangar; I looked for any damage and; at first; found none. But after pushing the aircraft back in the hangar and looking again for damage; I discovered some minor scratches on the leading edge of the left main landing gear strut.In my opinion this incident might have been prevented by greater recency of experience of taildragger operations.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
786,786,786,786,1837,MX was finishing up an inspection on Aircraft X. After the inspection was complete and I was finished auditing the inspection package; I received a phone call that our aircraft had been 'booked' for a revenue trip. I called for a fuel truck to upload 50K LBS of fuel onto Aircraft X and then went outside to wait for the fuel truck.A FBO worker (who supplies our fuel) showed up to take a metro-liner back down to the FBO; so I asked him when a fuel truck would be down to fuel Aircraft X. He stated that he was backed up right now; but that he would be down in a bit. He then asked if Aircraft X would need de-iced. I told him yes; to please de-ice the wings and tail. He then asked if he should de-ice the engine inlets too and I replied 'yes' a second time.I then went up a flight of stairs into the cockpit to make sure all of the avionics equipment was turned on and warming up as a revenue trip had been booked. When I was exiting the cockpit; but still at the top of the set of stairs; [personnel] in Operations texted me and asked if Aircraft X needed de-iced before it departed. I responded 'YES' and sent 2 pictures of Aircraft X's left wing; which has snow on it. [The Ops personnel] then responded 'Okay; thanks.'I then went inside to sign off the inspection and in the Airworthiness section on the same log page. After that paperwork was completed; I left work and went home. At approximately XA AM the next morning; I received a text from Chief Flight Engineer that the on-call weekend mechanic should go into work and look at the engines for possible FOD. I instructed the mechanic to do just that and he found the Number 1 engine with FOD to the C1 and C2 disk blades. When I received this news I asked the Chief Flight Engineer if the flight crew had de-iced Aircraft X after I left but prior to departure. He stated that the flight crew did not de-ice. He was with the aircraft all day and witnessed it takeoff so he would know.I'm not certain if I violated any FARs by signing off the inspection before the aircraft was de-iced but I wanted to document this in case I had and ice from the aircraft caused the damage to the Number 1 engine. The Number 1 engine is being replaced at this time and we hope to have the aircraft back in service safely within a few days. I have no idea why the flight crew canceled my request to de-ice Aircraft X; but I wish they hadn't.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I then noticed on my ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring) that the door was disarmed. I called back and let them know door is showing disarmed and FO tells me to make sure area outside R1 door is clear. I do that and then went back to see what is happening. Apparently the #1 FA (Flight Attendant) instead of disarming the door opened the door. When the FO went back he saw the FA holding the door trying to prevent the door from opening any further. The door at this point was opened about 6 to 8 inches. FO grabbed the door from FA and he tried to close it. Door would not move and FO was struggling to keep door in the position that it was in. At this point the FA moves the disarming handle which gave me my ECAM indication of the door being disarmed. That is the point that I called back and said I had a disarmed indication on the ECAM. After clearing the R1 area I went back. I asked the FO if there was any chance to close the door and he said there was no way. I told him to release the door.

788,788,788,788,4327,I; Mechanic A and Mechanic B were assigned 2 aircraft; Aircraft X and Aircraft Y. This scenario was out of the norm as we are usually assigned 1 aircraft per night. The reason this is abnormal is because the job for the night was an 'Entry to Park' card for Aircraft X and an 'Entry to Park' and a 'Return to Service' card for Aircraft Y. It was clear from the initial job assignments that these cards are taken very lightly and are considered nuisance cards or at least that is how they appeared. Aircraft X was assigned a XI:10 am trip and Aircraft Y was assigned a XG:30 am trip. The assignments were issued between XI:30 and XJ:00 pm. I myself have not entered an 'Entry to Park' AC and had many questions about the process as these airplanes were already at or beyond 48 hrs. on the ground. We were told to place Aircraft X into parking and leave it and to park and return to service Aircraft Y. This created much confusion for us on Aircraft Y. How do you park and return to service an aircraft immediately? Why are these cards issued now? Why the lack of manpower? What did they expect from us? How do we even accomplish these task in such a short amount of time? Do we have the ability to [apply] N/A to boxes? How did these surpass the clock? If we have to drain the water system and deactivate the heaters where are the planes parked to refill and reactivate? What equipment is available to get up to the tail and how far to get it there? Is there garbage on the airplane and do we have to dump it as per the card? Do we have to cover the pitot [tubes] only to take the tape off immediately? What airplane is the priority; the early out (because different parking spots indicate different abilities)? Why did safe go into maintenance mode when we were reviewing safe? Why did our ability to print the Procedures Manual go out for a half hour? Who do we contact; as the card suggested? Because management didn't have the answers for the questions we asked; I made two attempts to call Tech Services and the company phone dropped off and I had to use my cell and then that dropped off. The clock was ticking we made a choice to start with the aircraft on the gate after we found its location because it was going into parking and staying for dayshift. This gave us time for people to come back with the answers we needed to know about putting an aircraft into parking and taking it out immediately and how to handle. Normally we would have started with the early out aircraft. Mechanic A felt the pressure with comments such as they are going to expect these airplanes. My reassurance to him 'don't worry we just do our best' wasn't enough and he made a stand move alone while myself and Mechanic B were in the cabin and hit Aircraft X taking that airplane out of service with a 2.5 by 2.75 dent on the frame. The team was disheartened to say the least and we notified management immediately. After they arrived; Mechanic A was very distraught. I let them know that we did not even get to Aircraft Y yet and asked if they have an answer and what was the expectation for that plane. The answer was no answer yet; and yes they still expect that plane. This was around XA:30 to XB:00 am. So with that we finished off Aircraft X and the entry to park then we went to lunch very late; way past our union contract time. When I got back from lunch; all the paper work I had printed to start the next aircraft was removed from the east office and in some type of transportation mode so all the work was missing. Looking for the work brought us around XD:30 am and still could not locate it. End of shift was XE:30 and so we abandoned any potential work to be done on Aircraft Y. What is their expectations to accomplish an Entry to Parking and a Return to Service in a single night just for the sake of accomplishment with no real positive outcome other than to risk a failure?The cards need to be made more realistic or the company needs to be more realistic about their flight schedulesand actual workload. This whole program of parking needs to be revamped. This whole process left more questions than answers and different interpretations. It's a real mess in my personal opinion and in some cases may lead mechanic who has a work efficiency outlook to do it way different (some would say cut corners) than a mechanic who has a processes outlook and will park the plane before lunch then would return to service after lunch wasting materials and supplies and filling landfills simply because they realize that is the process.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

790,790,790,790,6679,The worst landing of my life. I have flown this C170 many times in past just myself as well as with 3 friends aboard and it became my favorite aircraft. Unfortunately; lately; this plane has ongoing electrical problems with generator and regulator. After some time the circuit breaker trips and system is not charging anymore. I had to return twice before due to same failure which the mechanics fixed; but the problem kept reappearing after a while. During this particular flight yesterday; I have decided to abort my flight because of same electrical failure due to the defective charging system. As I was returning back to departure airport; I was worrying that I will lose my radio before I arrive back. I was given clearance to land on Runway XXR. The wind conditions were variable as the windsock was not moving at all and then suddenly kept getting strong gusts from various directions. At the end of the flare; just before touchdown; sudden strong gust of crosswind from west threw my tail off so hard that I did not have sufficient rudder authority to compensate. I immediately applied full power to abort the landing and tried to go around. Unfortunately; I did not have time to push back the carb heat nor retract my full flaps which limited my engine power and kept high drag. This resulted in me being still just few feet above the ground and aiming diagonally across the grass to runway XXL; which was free of other traffic. Only after I managed to avoid collision with ground equipment and when I stabilized the airplane; I managed to push in the carb heat and slowly retract the flaps. The flaps are controlled by manual lever on this plane and are rather difficult to operate in such situation. I managed to successfully take off again and repeat the approach on left pattern. At numbers I was given clearance to land on Runway XXL.During base approach ATC changed my assigned runway to Runway XXR. I had to add power; but after turning final; I realized I added too much power and that I am too high. I tried to slip; but realized that it would not be safe; so I declared another go around; this time too high. On crosswind leg; ATC asked me if I need any help; which I declined. I was given landing clearance to Runway XXR and proceeded. I stabilized my approach; right landing speed at ~70 mph; but I did flare about a foot higher than would be optimal. Upon touchdown; it seems that my tail wheel locked in non-straight position. I immediately pushed full rudder to compensate; but still did not have sufficient rudder authority to fully correct. I held my elevator all the way up to keep the tail down and try to slow down the plane. I had to conscientiously keep telling myself to not to touch brakes; because I remember from ground school that it could result in dangerous situation. The aircraft started swerving and I departed Runway XXR to right into grass ~50 ft from taxiway Charlie where the aircraft rested safely. None of the parts of the aircraft except tires came into contact with ground. This situation fortunately resulted in zero injury; zero damage and was classified by airport personnel as 'Non-incident'.,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
791,791,791,791,7317,I was planning to fly from the ZZZ airport to my home on the lake a distance of approximately 5 NM. I was solo; and did a weight and balance and determined I needed 45 pounds of ballast in the nose anchor compartment; and confirmed it was there. The winds were very light out of the south and I took off on Runway XX and turned towards my home. I went to do a 'splash and dash' on the lake before going to the house so after climbing to about 500 ft. I reduced power and did my pre-water landing checklist. On touchdown I immediately did a water loop with no injury to me or any other property; and minor damage to the plane. I must have let the nose get too low; and possibly was hit by an unnoticed boat wake. Since I had lake specific recurrency training on [Date] and [Date1]; have done [Number] water landings; [Number1] in the last year and [Number2] in the last 90 days I do not know what else I should have done.I did notify the tower that I had a problem and was heading back on the water to the seaplane ramp. They called the fire department and asked them to launch a boat to assist if needed. When I got to the seaplane ramp their launch vehicle; trailer; and boat were on the left side of the ramp. I tried to call the tower to ask them to have the equipment moved; but could not raise them. I then tried to get up the right side of the ramp; and the right main gear went off the ramp and was damaged.

An experienced local pilot later said that strong gusts were occurring at the time of this incident. The resulting ground loop caused the plane to exit the asphalt surface. I felt I had avoided any major damage up to that point. However; as the aircraft left the paved surface; the starboard main gear wheel sank into the dirt. This caused the nose to strike the ground. The aircraft came to a stop with the nose; starboard landing gear; and starboard wing tip supporting the aircraft with the tail about 15 feet off the ground.Major contributing factors were; gusting crosswind.

It is extremely difficult to do safety checks during the boarding process of a full X type aircraft with the added pressure of the three members of management standing outside the boarding door.

I decided to taxi down 1L toward the ramp. During the taxi; First Officer (FO) and I discussed the need to deice before departure and whether or not to taxi directly back to the ramp. Tower instructed us to exit 01L at Bravo while we formulated a plan of action. Taxi to 01L and the taxi down 01L were normal with braking action fair. The turn on to Bravo was normal. Once on Bravo the aircraft started to slide and weather vane. I used a little differential thrust and braking to try to keep the aircraft on the centerline but the right downwind wheels left the taxiway. I set the parking brake and made a PA announcement to the pasengers informing them of the situation. We informed the tower of the situation and reported braking action on Bravo was nil. [A few minutes later] we were informed by the tower that the airport was closed with braking actions on all runways nil. A Medivac [aircraft] diverted and after about 30 minutes of worsening conditions an [air carrier] jet diverted also. From the time of the incident till when we departed for the hotel no other aircraft took off or landed in the airport remain closed.Initial reports from ground personnel stated that the #4 wheel was off the taxiway but after further inspection both wheels were in the dirt. The wind was 90deg off the left wingtip at 30+ gusting to 40. This force kept pushing and digging in the right wheels. Multiple PA's were make and the Passengers were kept informed thought the process. (FO) and I coordinated with tower/ground control; company operations; fire and rescue; company dispatch; Maintenance control; and the duty pilot. Logbook write-ups were made. We initially planned to tug the aircraft back onto the taxiway and tow it to the gate with passengers onboard but the presence of freezing rain and the condition of the taxiways made that impossible. After consulting Maintenance control we decided to bus the passengers to the terminal after the taxiways were deiced and cleared. Company personnel arrived and dropped the aft stairs and I consulted face to face with fire rescue and solidified the plan to deplane the passengers. While the busses were readied; I completed a walk around and installed the gear pin at the direction of Maintenance control. I then made a logbook write-up reflecting that. The taxiways needed to be deiced before the busses could safely be brought to the rear of the aircraft. All passengers and crew were deplaned without incident and injury. (FO) and I volunteered to stay behind and ride the brakes for maintenance control. I sent the flight attendants to the hotel and (FO) and I stayed behind. After approximately 45 minutes taxiway Bravo was deiced and a tug was attached to the airplane. After several attempts to pull the airplane out; the wheels appeared to be frozen in place and the tug was having trouble gaining traction. The decision was made to leave the airplane where it was. I called maintenance control to remind them to drain the potable water system due to the cold weather. After the situation was again reviewed with the mechanic on site we have left the airplane in his care with the APU running; packs on; all other systems secured.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
795,795,795,795,4447,Aircraft X had been written up by previous pilot for weak brakes that were not providing stopping power. Brakes had been bled the night prior to the incident and on taxi out for take off appeared to operate correctly. On approach to land; when arming the nose wheel steering; the MAP steering annunciator did not illuminate. We landed as winds were from heading 270 with speed in the mid teens gusting to mid twenties.Upon weight on wheels; steering annunciator still had not illuminated. Rudder pedals did not assist with directional control as the aircraft decelerated. I attempted differential braking to regain centerline as the aircraft was weather-vaning towards the right to discover brake lines had zero pressure. Then I attempted full reverse prop but with the cross wind the airplane was already committed to a right hand runway excursion. As the aircraft exited the runway; I pulled the engine stop and feathers. The aircraft rolled slowly until eventually stopping with the nose approximately thirty yards distance from the runway. Combination of mechanical failure and gusty cross winds are the main cause. No spilled fluids were discovered at scene of incident or along the path of the tow to the ramp to directly point towards faulty maintenance. However; I am positive maintenance crews were rushed the night before. Two lines out of our base airport were requiring metros for the week along with a charter flight calling for another. As of the night before the incident; of the four aircraft currently at our base; none of them were airworthy. My aircraft had been at the maintenance hangar since the prior week; but it was not until I was suppose to move it to the ramp the previous night that the write up on the brakes along with two other write ups were discovered to still be open. Possibly if I hadn't stayed late after my leg the previous night attempting to taxi airplanes around and then shown early again the morning of the incident; thereby legally being on duty the entire night; my reactions to the event may have been a little quicker. However; I am still confident I would of ended up off the right side of the runway with the conditions; I just probably wouldn't have rolled as far before coming to a full stop. During the approach phase; when the MAP steering annunciator did not illuminate upon attempting to arm the steering; I looked through the maintenance log and saw several months prior I had written up this same issue while in ZZZ1. At that time the First Officer that was along with me had said that the aircraft had always been this way. Upon touchdown as soon as there was weight on wheels the annunciator illuminated and we rolled out just fine; and then I wrote up the annunciator at that time.  Recalling that situation; I assumed that the steering would be available upon landing the morning of the incident. I also assumed if the steering was not available; I would have differential braking available just as if the steering had been MEL'd since the brakes appeared fine before departing. While rolling out for the right edge of the runway; the thought crossed my mind to attempt speeds low and possibly regain steering through the prop levers; however the aircraft was still moving fairly fast and training has reinforced that engaging steering in a bad situation will make the situation worse; especially if traveling with any speed. In hind site; I don't believe there is anything I could of done differently with the given situation. The brakes are suppose to be the back up for the steering thereby with the windy conditions not many options were available.Upon discovering the open write ups the night prior to the incident; Maintenance Control claimed the previous pilot had not reported the write ups over the phone. However this aircraft had been in front of the maintenance hangar with ample time for someone to have checked the book. Usually the books are taken out of the planes at the end of the day anyways; I'm assuming for this very reason. Having caught these write ups the week prior would have reduced the workload on maintenance the night prior to the incident. Combine this with majority of the write ups on the other aircraft being repeat write ups; Maintenance could really reduce their workload by actually fixing problems instead of trying to put them off. Whether this is an issue with needing to hire more mechanics or having more available planes to help rotate through and get work done correctly rather than always being rushed for the next morning's runs.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
796,796,796,796,2622,We landed just prior to a storm hitting the field and subsequently closing the airport. On taxi in; Operations advised us the ramp was closed due to lightning; however; they could use the Mobile Aircraft Parking System (MAPS) to park us at XXX. They would not be able to chock us and bring up the jet bridge due to the closed ramp. We decided to wait on Taxiway A until the storm passed; and the ramp opened. After approximately 30 minutes; Operations radioed us to let us know the Supervisor was in the MAPS vehicle at our gate and that he would direct us in and be able to chock the aircraft to allow the jet bridge to approach the plane; even though the ramp was still closed. We proceeded to the gate.It was nighttime and the visibility was poor due to rain and wet surfaces making it very difficult to see the taxi lines or the J-line. We attempted to line up with the MAPS vehicle and realized we were well to the right of the J-line. We came to a stop because we were not lined up properly and noticed the MAPS vehicle was lined up on the right side of the J-line from our view. We had thought the MAPS vehicle was directly over top of the J-line and they were not. I had to make a hard left inside the Safety Zone to line up with the J-line and park the aircraft.  After parking the aircraft; I realized how dumb an idea the MAPS vehicle really is. We are required to have a Marshaller; and two wing walkers when the weather is good. When the visibility is poor; it's dark; and the ramp is closed; it's acceptable to use a truck with lights to park the aircraft? The MAPS vehicle was in the wrong position for parking and we lined up with it. We could have easily hit something in the very congested XXX gate area because of bad operational ideas (i.e. MAPS vehicle). I allowed Operations to talk me into taxiing into the gate with the MAPS vehicle and I completely regret making that decision.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

During preflight planning I reviewed the taxi chart and NOTAMs. The taxi chart showed that Taxiway C no long exists west of G. The NOTAMs state this as well. I marked up my taxi chart to reflect the closure. We taxied on B across both 19 Runways. As we approached D we anticipated turning right because we anticipated that we would have to taxi on A to get to the departure end of 26R. We were given taxi instructions to turn left on D. We started to turn right when the Ground Controller told us to turn left. We then saw that Taxiway C still exists. We then understood that he wanted us to take C to the departure end of 26R. No runway incursions occurred. Not traffic conflicts occurred. No 'possible pilot deviation' was mentioned. I am writing this because the taxi diagram and NOTAM do not reflect what actually exists.

799,799,799,799,9520,Several times prior to push the tug drive asked to pull electrics. Per current SOP we delayed APU start. This tug driver did not use correct verbiage and showed great impatience. [Nine] min before scheduled push he again used non standard terms and said he was ready for push; I said standby. We completed the before push and called ramp for push. During the First Officers (FOs) call the tug driver again asked if we would release brakes. I said I would when I received my push clearance. Less than 10 seconds later the FO told me cleared to push spot D. He turned on the beacon I released the brakes and using intercom told the tug driver brakes released cleared to push spot D. I received no answer. I repeated the call. I then noticed the forward cargo door was opening. I told the FO to cancel our push and reset the brakes. What I found out was the driver left the tug to help load the bags. So while the belt loader was against the airplane and ground crew was loading bags our brakes were released no chocks and no one in the tug protecting against movement. I do not consider this a safe operation. At no time did the tug driver advise loading of additional bags. He removed himself from the headset after clearing me to release brakes. I called operations and asked for a supervisor. I was told none available; all in a meeting and it would take too long. As I could not trust this pushback crew; more to the point I doubted their training and ability to conduct a safe push back; I asked for another pushback crew. Again I was told it would take too long. I said fine I would wait. They ended up rotating a wing walker for the tug driver. Neither operations or the push crew seemed to think anything was out of the ordinary. I accepted the new drive and push was normal except again verbiage was incorrect and he forgot to clear us to start number 2 engine.

Captain was Pilot Flying. On our takeoff roll; just prior to V1; I seemed to notice a mist in the cockpit. I called V1; and Rotate at the appropriate speeds when I smelled smoke. I noticed the mist; which turned out to be smoke; getting thicker in the flight deck. As we rotated and climbed out; I could hear 'Fire; fire; fire' from the Passengers in the cabin. Simultaneously; the Flight Attendants (FA) were calling to the cockpit. The Captain and I quickly ascertained that the odor was deicing fluid and that was causing the smoke. I answered the FAs call and they told me about the smoke. I told them that it was the deicing fluid but to call me if they saw flames or it got worse. I then made a PA telling the Passengers that the smoke was caused by the deicing fluid coming through the vents of the aircraft and that everything was under control. I checked on with Departure and then donned my O2 mask.

803,803,803,803,4202,After clearing runway we observed an avionics smoke ECAM. Although no smoke was detected in the cockpit the Purser was called and he said that he thought there might be a sent of smoke in the forward galley. I immediately taxied to gate while the First Officer called Maintenance to have them come to the aircraft to check the avionics compartment (a message was sent as well). The marshaller parked us just past the stop line (within a couple of inches). The CSR refused to bring the jetway up to the aircraft although I opened my window and told him to bring the jetway up anyway as we might have smoke (possibly fire) and we needed to deplane the passengers and allow myself or the First Officer to immediately inspect the avionics compartment as Maintenance was no where in sight. Although we were past the stop line the jetway could have been brought up and the door opened. Meanwhile the marshaller had disconnected and I could not talk to him. At this point I opened door 1L myself and had to jump the 2 and a half feet to the jetway so that I could run down to the ramp and open the avionics compartment door myself to check for smoke as again Maintenance was not there. No smoke was observed. I nearly had to call for the Fire Department to get any response from anyone. It seems that there is some sort of turf war going on between Customer Service and Ramp as to how the aircraft are parked.

804,804,804,804,4359,About 25-30 minutes after leveling off at FL 300 we received a call from the Purser stating there was a strong odor of burning rubber in the main cabin and it was intensifying. I spoke with the Relief Pilot; who was on his crew break; and he confirmed the odor and the passengers and Flight Attendant's were extremely concerned. I had the Relief Pilot return as we declared 'pan; pan; pan' and began a turn to ZZZZ. I briefed the purser on the situation with and had her prep the a/c and crew for landing in 25 minutes. We dumped about 28;000 LBS of fuel. I had the Relief Pilot remain on the interphone with a flight attendant during the whole time to keep us apprised of the situation in the cabin. We ran QRH procedures for 'Fire or Smoke or Fumes' checklist. During the descent we noticed the odor subsided after we turned off utility buses and selected 'Standby' on the equipment cooling selector. We landed overweight in ZZZZ on Runway XXL. After clearing runway we had AARF inspect exterior of aircraft and when given the OK we taxied to gate.After gate arrival we were met by a host of ground personnel. I was informed by the ZZZZ Police that the passengers were not able to deplane for security reasons. We eventually got this rectified and the people were allowed to deplane to a secure gate area. The passengers were extremely thankful but visibly shaken. Maintenance began going through the E&E compartment troubleshooting that area. One of the mechanics returned to cockpit and told me that it was extremely hot in the E&E compartment. Another Mechanic returned to the cockpit with a piece of ducting; elbow shaped; and said he found it near the right pack. Then another Mechanic returned to cockpit and told me he found a loose cannon plug from right pack that controlled auto shut down of pack in event of compressor discharge. While the mechanics continued working on aircraft the flight crew went to operations. While there; Crew Scheduling called us and told us we would go illegal on duty time in a short time. Shortly after that; Maintenance informed me they had found a part but it was off the airfield a few miles. They would have to retrieve the part; return to airport; clear security; install part and perform an engine run-up. I began to have serious doubts about them completing this task safely in the time available as it appeared everyone was rushing. I spoke with Operations Managers; neither a pilot or mechanic; and explained I felt we were being pushed to take this aircraft. In the meantime; I received a phone call from the Purser and she explained that she and several of the other flight attendants were very apprehensive taking this aircraft back out because of the fumes and odors as well as another item already deferred concerning 'wheel well fire detection' requiring us; per MEL; to leave gear extended for 10 minutes after takeoff. This was day 4 on the placard. I returned to jet to find the General Manager and the Director of Maintenance on board. I spoke with them about the issues and told him I was not comfortable with aircraft. The General Manager told me I had to speak to mechanics because they had fixed the aircraft. I politely asked them to be present when I spoke to mechanics. I explained to General Manager that if I took this aircraft and diverted again what the ramifications would be. I then asked him if he was prepared to take that responsibility and his answer to me was 'No'. I then asked the two mechanics if they could definitively say that the ducting elbow caused the smell of burning rubber and by replacing it would fix the problem and their answer was 'No'. We were now less than 30 minutes from going illegal on duty day. I declined the aircraft. We went to hotel for a short layover and returned the next morning to fly the flight with a different aircraft.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
805,805,805,805,5281,During the boarding process I was made aware that the B Flight Attendant at the overwing exit; along with several passengers in his immediate vicinity; smelled a hot; rubbery; somewhat plastic burning smell. We stopped boarding and it was apparent we did not have a worsening situation by the demeanor of the passengers in the cabin. I could not see or smell anything untoward from the forward galley. I then went to mid-cabin myself to see what; if anything; I could smell and talk to any passengers who smelt the smell. While I could not smell anything; it was clear in talking to several passengers the B Flight Attendant had accurately described the smell; but it must have been very localized; as when talking with the deadheading Captain; about seven rows behind the exit; he had not smelled anything. At this point; we had checked for obvious sources such as lights and overhead bags and nothing was noted. I did not believe it to be the ground air source as the smell was so localized. I made a PA to the passengers informing them we had had an unknown odor reported while boarding and would need a little while to talk with Maintenance. We were just about to call Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss the writeup (as clearly this would need a maintenance inspection at the very least with an unknown heat source/burning smell); when the A Flight Attendant came forward to inform me the source had been located. A passenger; seated right next to the B flight attendant at the overwing exit; had multiple e-cigarettes and one battery shorted out; overheating another. I had them bring the passenger to the flight deck and I talked with him. We had him bring his backpack (which was under the seat in front of him) to the jetway and the B Flight Attendant was able to; without any doubt; confirm the smell was exactly the same. The vapes were wrapped in a large Ziploc back and the bag was hot to the touch. The Operations Agent asked the passenger if he had any more vape materials in his backpack and he did. The Operations Agent then asked if he could remove all those and if he would consent to a voluntary search of his back; which he agreed to. Other than the Vape materials he showed us; there were no others. We had the passenger with the vape materials remain in the jetway and First Officer and I consulted our manuals. We found some reference to EFB battery thermal runaway issues but nothing for passenger luggage overheating issues; other than the general inflight QRH guidance. We did find a reference to it being a HAZMAT reportable incident. I made another PA to the passengers informing them that the source of the odor had been located; and what it was. I also told them it would require some additional paperwork and to give us fifteen minutes to resolve the issue. I consulted with my First Officer and the Flight Attendants and we were all in agreement it was safe and appropriate to continue the flight. I then called Dispatch and the Chief Pilot on Call and they both; along with the SOD; agreed it was appropriate to continue boarding and dispatch the flight. As we had burned below minimum planned fuel; we also amended the Dispatch Release to allow legal dispatch without a further delay to load more fuel. We allowed the offending passenger; sans vape materials to re-board and boarded the remaining passengers. I made a PA to all the passengers thanking them for their patience and understanding and the rest of the flight was uneventful. The passenger with the vape material; other than being disappointed that the vapes that didn't short out could not travel with him; was most understanding and cooperative. My First Officer; all three Flight Attendants and ISP Operations acted in an exemplary manner throughout the whole event. All the passengers were most understanding throughout the event too.

806,806,806,806,10734,At night; during very windy conditions; we were cleared for the RIVER Visual 19 into DCA. The approach was uneventful until we were crossing one of the last bridges and making one of our last turns. The Captain was the pilot flying and made significant crosswind corrections in order to stay over the river and not get blown into prohibited airspace. During the last phase of the approach; he made too much of a crosswind correction and drifted towards the right side of the river; where there are a cluster of buildings. I felt at that time that we were slightly too low and not over the river. I spoke up and said 'we are too low' approximately at the same time the GPWS alerted us 'caution obstacle'. The Captain immediately made a flight path correction; the caution went away. Both of us were very focused on getting the runway in sight and making the necessary turns. It was busy; windy and at night. It crossed my mind that we should have done a go-around. I couldn't remember if it was mandatory at night; or what and/or statements were in the QRH. Everything happened very fast and I felt that due to the intensity of the approach; the busy ATC conditions; and the windy conditions; that neither of us had time to think. We landed uneventfully and after getting to the gate; discussed the event. One of the items mentioned was that a go-around at that point was unnerving. It is a complicated go-around in that airspace under those conditions; at that point. Nevertheless; both of us agreed that we deviated from SOP and were required to go around. We looked it up in the QRH and that confirmed that we had made an error on that approach.Follow SOP.

807,807,807,807,7770,During approach runway 25L HKG; day VMC; FO (First Officer) was the flying pilot; at about 300 ft he announced: autopilot off auto throttles off; he disconnected the autothrottles with one click which triggered the beeper and master caution; I immediately reset the master caution to silence the beeper; next; the aircraft was pitching up and climbing and the thrust increasing followed by the master warning and siren due to the auto pilot disconnecting; seeing that we were no longer on a stable approach and not in a position to land safely; I called 'go around'; and the go around was initiated; ATC was advised and the autopilot re-engaged; we carried on the missed approach as published. ATC queried about the reason for the Go around and we informed them that it was due to an unstable approach on short final.  During the go around; when the autopilot was re-engaged; I mistakenly selected the left autopilot; now level at 6000 ft on a long downwind portion of the missed approach; still trying to figure out what exactly happened that caused the go around; I asked the FO to disconnect the autopilot so I can engage the right autopilot; and I noticed that he was pushing the TOGA (Take Off Go Around) switches to disconnect the autopilot! It became apparent what happened at 300 ft; he disconnected the autothrottles but mistook the yoke autopilot disconnect switch with the TOGA switches and he pushed the TOGA switches instead; which advanced the thrust levers and initiated an autopilot coupled go around; not realizing why the airplane was pitching up; he overpowered the autopilot by applying forward pressure on the yoke to stop it from pitching up thus disengaging the autopilot and causing the master warning and the siren to go off! After a brief discussion going over what went wrong to avoid repeating the same scenario; ATC vectored us for another approach and the FO flew a stable approach; disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles properly and we landed safely on Runway 25L.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
808,808,808,808,10661,Our routing into DEN was filed on the PEEKK RNAV STAR via OURAY transition. Upon switching to ZDV (DEN Center); we were cleared onto the LDORA1 arrival. With some low level convective activity ahead on the arrival; we were expecting to ask for some slight deviations for weather. We switched to the next ZDV sector; and we were given a left turn heading 340 degrees for en route spacing. Several minutes later we were cleared to intercept the TELLR1 arrival. Shortly thereafter ZDV tells us: '...cleared to deviate up to 15 degrees either side of course; and descend via the TELLR1 arrival.' By this time we were both heads down for most of the descent reprogramming and verifying all the new route changes; as well as the new constraints. ZDV handed us off to DEN TRACON at FL250; and we were then issued to proceed direct POWDR direct DVV; and to descend and maintain 17;000. We were then cleared to deviate at our discretion for weather avoidance to DVV. Normal radar vectors and altitudes from the mid-teens to landing were then provided by TRACON. Also; we twice experienced airspeed anomalies during the managed descent. The FMGC and charted speeds were not being followed correctly by the airspeed tape. It was commanding 210 KTS instead of the required 250 and 280 KT speeds. We as the pilots had to manually select the correct speeds; and also use full speed brakes to meet required altitudes. This required the jet to be hand flown several times on the RNAV STAR just to be at the correct altitude and airspeed at several fixes.

811,811,811,811,1527,Crew arrived at the airport following short overnight to originate using aircraft B737-400. The aircraft was still parked off gate at the hardstand having spent the night at the airport. When ramp personnel started the APU and turned on air conditioning pack; the cabin filled with smoke and fumes. Ramp personnel opened all doors and ventilated the aircraft before finally delivering it to gate. I was standing in the jetway as the forward entry door was opened and immediately smelled a very strong locker room or dirty sock smell which was very intense; acrid; and irritating. I took two steps into the aircraft entry and immediately turned around and hurried off the aircraft due to the intensity of the probable toxic fumes. I informed the agents that that aircraft was not safely acceptable for operation in its' current condition. I then began co-ordinating between the Dispatcher; Crew Scheduling; Maintenance; and the local agents to remedy the situation. I was told there was a pool of oil found in the air conditioning pack. I called the Chief Pilots Office and told one of the new assistants the situation and that it was necessary for health and safety reasons to refuse the aircraft. Ground personnel ventilated the aircraft with all doors open for about another hour and ran the pack. I was then asked to re-evaluate the smell. I was concerned about filling the cabin with passenger and 5 crew then shutting all doors those harmful possibly toxic fumes would be inhaled by all onboard. As soon as I entered the jetway; I could smell the same odor but at reduced intensity. I closed all doors except the forward entry door and ran both packs individually for a short period of time; then did a cabin inspection. I could still smell the fumes and was uncomfortable on the airplane. So I re-opened the doors to ventilate and exited the airplane. Two different crew members entered the aircraft and confirmed the smell. I then informed Scheduling; Dispatcher; Maintenance Control; and the local agents that the aircraft was unacceptable in its' current condition still. The flight was then canceled. After all this; I was finally able to review the aircraft logbook for the first time. Incredibly; there was no entry by Maintenance of the occurrence or remedial action taken. They told me they didn't want it documented in the maintenance log but that they would fill out their forms. I informed Local Maintenance that that was unacceptable. To resolve the issue; I entered a maintenance log book write-up describing the occurrence to force Maintenance to properly document the discrepancy and remedial work performed so far to correct the problem. Local Maintenance also tried to tell me it was anti-ice fluid that was burned by the APU but that is an entirely different smell and a ridiculous attempt to send an unsafe aircraft into operations. The next flight out to our base was scheduled to depart mid afternoon. That aircraft inbound experienced an electrical malfunction so an aircraft swap was accomplished with guess which aircraft; the one we refused. The new crew for that flight were lied to and told the problem was anti-ice fluid being burned by the APU and that everything was fine. Incredibly; the new crew elected to take the aircraft. My crew wouldn't even deadhead home on that aircraft and traveled home on our own. And by the way; this was our last day and last leg of this trip so we had nothing to gain from a delay or cancellation on what would be our flight home. The very fact that I feel it necessary to mention this is a testament to the poor safety culture at this airline. This is a continuation of the toxic fume problem that is ongoing at this airline while management continues to apply band aids and attempt to intimidate crews to operate unsafe aircraft. The attempt to keep aircraft discrepancies and maintenance actions performed on the aircraft out of the maintenance log book to avoid documented history is criminal and prevents the next crew from obtaining valuable information. And of course; it is illegal per FAR's as well. Yet the FAA and the US legal system continue to look the other way.

I told her to call me back after she deals with the fire and we would begin our descent. We [advised ATC] at that time and began our checklist items. After our oxygen masks were donned; the Flight Attendant called again and said there was no fire and that the electrical smell had subsided. We then informed ATC of the situation and had a normal landing in ZZZ.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
816,816,816,816,9618,During landing the tire blew and created a metal grinding sound as the plane was taxing. The Captain made the decision to discontinue taxing and park the aircraft and wait for Maintenance to arrive. An announcement was made by the Captain that the tire would need to be changed and it would be at least an additional 30 minute delay. The A Flight Attendant spoke with Captain and confirmed the information given over the PA. Flight Attendant A conferred with the remaining Flight Attendant crew B; C; and D that we needed to perform a water service due to the extended delay. A PA was made by the A Flight Attendant explaining the crew would be offering water. At this time the passenger in First Class exited from the lavatory requesting a rum and Coke. An apology was given and it was explained to him that we were only offering water. He became upset and questioned the A Flight Attendant. Flight Attendant D also explained we were on the tarmac and would not be serving alcohol. The passenger had consumed 4 alcoholic beverages in flight possibly 5 because it was believed he consumed his traveling companions' beverage. This does not include pre-departure service. (The passenger did not display signs of intoxication during the flight). He repeatedly kept asking about the delay and at one point was on his cell phone at the 1L door and A Flight Attendant overheard him say 'the Flight Attendant is lying' and he had used some derogatory language. Just as the A Flight Attendant was about to ask him to take his seat he sat down. He then proceeded to ask about the delay again. That's when I; the A Flight Attendant said I would see what was going on. I allowed the passenger to fluster me and take me away from policy and procedures and I opened the door to verify Maintenance fixing the problem [the emergency escape slide deployed]. I honestly wanted him to leave me alone. I was frustrated; tired; and just simply flustered. I thought I had performed self monitor and challenge; but I had allowed myself to become totally distracted from my actual duties. Putting myself; the crew; and the individuals on the tarmac in an unsafe situation. I allowed a passenger to distract me and take me away from procedural duties.

817,817,817,817,3113,Flight was delayed approximately two hours for an engine change.  This was an ETOPS flight that required an in flight verification.  At top of climb; crew noticed that the left hydraulic system quantity was .71rf.  It appeared to be losing .01 every 2-3 minutes.  Crew contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control.  Maintenance Control became aware that this was an ETOPS verification flight and agreed that the aircraft did not pass verification and would not be released ETOPS.  The quantity continued to slowly decrease albeit at a decreased rate.  The lowest reading in the left system was .56rf. Coordination between Maintenance and Dispatch resulted in a decision to land at ZZZ because it was the optimum station to take care of crew; passengers; and airplane.   After coordinating with ATC; diversion to ZZZ was commenced.  The flight crew then became aware of a flight attendant injured by a cart and a flight attendant who had a history of DVT and was complaining of possible blood clots.  As a precaution paramedics were advised to meet the flight in ZZZ for the two flight attendants.  During divert the Diversion guide was consulted and since we would be landing overweight we dumped remaining 6000 lbs from the center wing.  All checklists were accomplished and aircraft was recovered into ZZZ with normal approach and landing.

818,818,818,818,8279,We had pushed off of gate. After calling for taxi; ground control instructed us to taxi to runway via X; Y; behind another air carrier. I read back the instructions. The controller then issued new instructions. We were to taxi to [runway] via Z; A; Y; behind the other aircraft. I read back the instructions and the Captain then verified the instructions by repeating them to me. We started to taxi via Z. I then saw that the Aircraft Y had turned onto taxiway X heading east toward us. The distance from taxiway Y to Z on X is rather short. I became concerned that perhaps the Captain hadn't noticed the other aircraft had turned onto taxiway X. I told him we had to stop for the Aircraft Y. Due to the timing and short distance involved an abrupt stop was necessary to avoid encroaching onto the taxiway in front of the other aircraft. After the stop I called the cabin to see if the flight attendants were okay. The flight attendant I spoke with informed me that she was injured and that she believed all the flight attendants were injured. I asked if they needed medical assistance and she said yes. I informed ground we had possible injuries and needed to return to the gate. I then called operations to inform them of our return and to have medical assistance dispatched to meet us.

819,819,819,819,1294,We were east of FEWWW intersection on the BRDJE1 arrival when we were given a hold due to flooding on the runways at DFW. We held for approximately 10 minutes and were then given the SEEVR1 arrival; direct to CHMLI intersection. In the meantime the captain was ACARSing dispatch to have our alternate changed. We were given another hold at CHMLI intersection. I mentioned two times in the hold that I wasn't sure the fuel was going to work because we were getting close to our minimum fuel for the approach; and the captain informed me that 'we would be fine.' We never got our fuel burn to [the new alternate] from dispatch so I didn't have numbers to calculate our hold fuel to that airport. About the time that dispatch sent us a BINGO number the captain was trying to request with ATC that we get put back on the arrival or we divert to our alternate. This took a few minutes. We were put back on the SEEVR1 arrival again and attempted an approach to runway 17C. At about 160ft the captain initiated a go around due to the crosswind and the aircraft feeling unstable.At this point we told ATC that we needed to go to [our original alternate].

820,820,820,820,919,Following a normal takeoff and in conjunction with gear retraction; we heard a loud bang; and observed the airplane to yaw sharply to the right. Within 200 feet; it became evident that our RH (right hand) engine was surging with ITT at maximum. We reduced the RH throttle to idle and observed stable indications. The Tower was advised of our emergency status; and we made a single engine RH traffic pattern to a landing. Airport fire and emergency services approached the airplane after we came to a complete stop on the runway. Smoke was observed from the RH engine; so we elected to evacuate our 4 passengers plus 2 crew.

821,821,821,821,5432,Over the last few years; the U.S. airport system has been installing extremely bright LED lighting that is blinding to pilots. Most of this is centerline taxiway lighting which; in my opinion; isn't even necessary except in extremely low visibility situations. We can see the painted yellow centerline and the blue edge lights. If there were an animal; FOD; or even a human on the taxiway; we would be quite challenged to see it while blinded by these lights. Some airports have extremely bright approach lights and centerline runway lights as well that also blind us. I have asked ATC if they could lower them and I always get told that they are as low as they go in a frustrated and empathetic tone indicating that they are often requested to lower them.Who decides on the lighting systems installed? Obviously not a user! Most pilots I fly with have issue with this; but everyone just sucks it up and doesn't say anything until we have an incident. If those lights were significantly dimmer wouldn't that save money? Install dimmer bulbs or a dimming system that could go to much lower settings. Don't even use the taxiway centerline lights unless under SMIGS operations. Get feedback from users before installing stuff.

Did the pre-flight and everything seemed normal. Pre-flight and final walk around was checked by [Instructor]. The plan for this lesson was to practice landings. We taxi to Runway XXR; did the run up; after it; we were cleared for takeoff to do a close traffic. Took off; did the first pattern and landed. Exit Runway XXR at Taxiway X. Then I requested Ground Control taxi back to Runway XXR. When we were holding short Runway XXR at Taxiway B; I was doing pre-takeoff checklist when I noticed smoke coming from the right engine cowling. Then the first thing I did was kill the right mixture. My instructor saw the smoke and we shut down everything; including fuel selectors; and electrical. We exited the aircraft and stayed away from it.

823,823,823,823,3523,Taking off from ZZZ; Captain informed us to stay in our seats until he calls. After we crossed 10;000 feet and the chime went off; we remained in our seats as instructed. The Number one pointed me to the oven and there was smoke coming out. I took my seat belt off and got up to turn the oven off and didn't open it and got back to my jump seat and strapped in. There was a lot of turbulence. Then we heard a noise like when the wheels dropped for landing; the plane was still climbing and then it started turning. No 1 and I realized that this was not normal. [We] immediately called the cockpit and they told us that they will get back to us in a second; we realized something was up. Captain called and instructed [us] with info: 10 mins; Fire trucks were going to meet the flight and there was a issue with the flaps. [We] spoke to the number 2 and asked him if he had listened to the instructions that we need to run the Emergency checklist. I was concerned about that but also the smoke coming out of the oven. [We] went through the tablet Check list. [Number 1] made all the necessary PAs from the check List and kept giving me instructions. It was extremely turbulent. [Another flight attendant] got up from her jump seat and went to Exit rows to move some of the Deadhead FAs to the exit row. I couldn't leave the 1L-1R and forward galley area because we were close to the ground and turbulence was very strong. Plus the smoke from the oven continued but was dissipating it was mild but I did not want to leave it unattended. We returned to our jump seats and conducted our 30 second reviews; together which included our handicapped passengers and our Unaccompanied Minor onboard. We touched down; the plane took a long time to stop and we were expecting an impact any minute. I said get ready 'this is real; it's happening'. Finally the plane came to a stop and the Captain made a PA. This is the Pilot remain seated; followed by a PA about the Fire department checking the tires because the aircraft had a heavy landing.

824,824,824,824,5845,This was the third day of this trip. The Captain had regularly been arriving to the aircraft fairly late and then would wait to brief or run any checklists until nearly door closure. The Captain was consistently rushing though checklists and occasionally missing items on the checklist after calling them correctly configured. I would reiterate the checklist item and he would usually then realize his mistake. Weather was good at the departure airport with clear skies and light winds. This flight was my leg. After liftoff the normal call out exchange of 'positive rate' and 'gear up' was made. However; the Captain reached over and retracted the flaps; which were set at 15 degrees; instead of the landing gear. I noticed this as the flap lever was reaching the zero degree detent as the aircraft was climbing through approximately 150-200 ft. AGL. I ensured the aircraft was stable; at a safe airspeed; and still climbing and once again called 'gear up.' The Captain acted somewhat confused by this and finally retracted the landing gear. I believe at this point he finally realized what he had done with the flaps; and stated 'well that was weird.' No further discussion occurred about what had happened for the remainder of the flight.The Captain's rush to accomplish duties and checklists; and especially his incorrect configuration change of the aircraft at low altitude made me very unsafe and concerned about the potential outcome of that flight and future flights. I feel [that] this Captain could use additional reiteration and training of standard operations. He is a long-time Captain with [the Company]; so knowledge of procedures doesn't seem to be the cause of this instance.

825,825,825,825,3473,We started our push from the gate. About half way through the push we started to hear a squealing/Rubbing sound. As the ramp agents were disconnecting the tug the sound got louder and we started to smell burning/fumes of some sort. We couldn't identify it and it got very strong. It appeared to be rubber or electrical.I shut down both engines and the flight attendant called on the PA she initially said that she didn't smell anything then stated that she was smelling something. I then determined the smell didn't appear to be subsiding so I decided the best course of action was to get the people off the plane. I verified verbally with her that the prop was stopped and told her to evacuate through the main cabin door only. The First Officer was talking to Ramp Control who had fire trucks on the way.

826,826,826,826,214,On the takeoff roll we experienced the notorious 'dirty sock' smell. The smell was quite strong. I elected to continue the takeoff as we were already above 80 knots. As we began our climbout the smell began to fade; and eventually seemed to go away outside an occasional whiff detected by myself or my First Officer. We were unable to put our oxygen masks on during the event as we were task saturated flying the airplane. I sent an ACARS to Dispatch to notify them of the smell and that we would need Maintenance in ZZZ1. Dispatch asked if the smell had been present in the cabin; and after speaking with my flight attendants I confirmed that they had not noticed anything. Upon arriving in ZZZ1 I wrote up the discrepancy as 'dirty sock smell in cockpit only'. ZZZ1 Maintenance deferred Pack 1 and the smell was not noticed on subsequent flights.As additional information based upon my review of the aircraft logbook; this has been a recurring issue with this aircraft; having been written up no less than 3 times in the last month. The Pack that was deferred is also associated with an engine that has had multiple write ups for high LP (Low Pressure) vibration and seems to have a high rate of oil consumption.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
827,827,827,827,10092,During cruise over we noticed an acrid burning smell and immediately detected thin white smoke in the cockpit. We donned the oxygen masks and smoke goggles and the First Officer (FO) began working the checklists. We began a descent and quickly decided to divert to a nearby airport; as it was directly ahead of us. We messaged the company; informed the Flight Attendant and passengers; and requested CFR. As ATC got us down to 9;000 feet fairly quickly; I had some time and thought there might be a closer airport but the smoke had dissipated and we decided it was better to stick with the current plan. We removed our masks to preserve oxygen in case the smoke returned; proceeded to the airport and landed unremarkably.Obviously smoke in the cockpit is a big threat. Just after deciding to go to ZZZ I noticed the flight time was 15 minutes but; because we descended to 9;000 feet it took a good bit longer at 250 KTS. We did discuss going back up to 10;000 feet to accelerate. Instead we used the time to set up the approach and discuss the plan upon arrival with the CFR crew. I did not have good situational awareness as to the distance to the diversion airport.After seeing smoke I think the most important consideration is getting on the ground as quickly as possible. It would have been faster to have an alternate airport in mind from the onset; but I did not at that moment. If the smoke had increased we might have headed to the nearest 5;000 foot runway. We could have decreased the flight time by flying [faster] at 10;000 feet or choosing a closer runway. The FO was well trained and did a good job.

828,828,828,828,5803,The Captain and I were getting ready to push on leg 4/4; [out of SJC]; on what had become a pretty long day. The pushback crew was trying to establish communication; the Ops Agent had just given us our [information] sheet which said we had like 25 minutes left to get airborne without a waiver. We had started our first two legs each with mechanical delays; and now were roughly 2.5 hours behind schedule. I tried to get the latest ATIS for push and that's when I realized that people on Tower frequency were making CTAF calls. We were unable to get digital ATIS and had to tune it on the radio. The weather was VFR; 10 SM and clear skies. This made me scratch my head a bit as I hadn't expected the tower to close; although it was [late at night] local time so it was late enough. There were no specific instructions regarding a closed tower in the Dispatch Release and nothing in our CPDLC which I had gotten 15 minutes earlier while the tower was still open. It then occurred to me that maybe there was some info on the airport pages regarding CTAF operations. The only reference at all was regarding the curfew - all jet operations prohibited during curfew hours of [early morning period]. Delayed scheduled air carrier flights and alternate/emergency operations excluded from restrictions. That's when the Captain asserted that since we had our CPDLC clearance and departure frequency we should be good to takeoff and talk to departure. At this point I feel like fatigue was really hampering my decision making ability; because I had a little acorn of doubt in the back of my head that we needed to clarify what exactly we needed to do; but instead of discussing my doubt I just rationalized the Captain's reasoning as good enough and went with it. So we pushed back and I made CTAF calls that we were taxiing to the runway. Initially there was a regional aircraft landing; then a helicopter; and then it was quiet. We approached the hold short and we could see an aircraft on final which our TCAS showed at 5 NM. The Captain said he was going to keep it rolling and I made our final CTAF call announcing our departure saying that we were making a right turnout; but I flubbed the name of the departure. It was my leg so he gave me the aircraft and we took off uneventfully. We got the gear up; accelerated; and then at 1500 feet he gave Departure a call. Initially the Controller asked us to squawk identification and then I heard some excitement in his voice when he came back. I can't remember the exact verbiage but something to the extent of 'Aircraft X; you can't just take off into controlled airspace without a clearance...' That's when my heart sank. I kept flying the SID but I was mad at myself because I knew I had that nugget of doubt and I could have asserted myself to avoid this situation. As we checked out of NorCal's airspace the Controller gave us a phone number to call for a potential Pilot Deviation. Looking back at this situation; after having gotten some sleep; I saw a couple of factors that I believe played a role in this occurrence. First; taking off with a closed tower is something I have never done at Company. I've done it at previous jobs; but I always took off VFR and remained VFR; or got my IFR while airborne in VMC; but never from an airport with an overlying Class B airspace. At Company I have landed with a closed tower; but there were specific instructions outlined in the SIP for that airport which made it clear what we needed to do. In our situation; because of the delay; we found ourselves working late at night at an airport where we don't usually fly that late; and no amplifying instructions. I don't know why it didn't dawn on me to address with the Captain the fact that I'd never done this before at Company.Second; we had received our CPDLC while the tower was still open but nowhere along the way did we realize; or did anybody (Dispatch; Clearance; Tower; etc.) tell us; that the tower would be closed upon departure.I actually had to call Tower and ask them to resend my CPDLC because it dropped out of our box. He said ok; and did so; but didn't mention he would be closing soon. I'm in no way trying to shift any blame; but it seems that somebody could have given us a heads up. Who knows; maybe tower did try to call? I wasn't actively monitoring them on the speaker so I don't know if they did. Third; as I mentioned before; I was tired and that impacted my ability to scrutinize this situation. We had been on duty for roughly 10 hours at this point. I was up early with my family and was running on fumes at this point in the night. As we were arriving into SJC the Captain and I were discussing our fatigue level; but neither of us said that we were unfit to continue. Maybe a bit of 'get-there-itis' paired with 'we can make this happen.' I've read all the stats that are put out about fatigue; and I know they're true; but honestly I've just not had all that many situations where the effects of fatigue have caused something like this to happen to me. It's pretty eye opening and I feel like we really should have talked more about it as a crew.Fourth; I should have been more familiar with information available to me from Company publications. After the fact I have since gone back and found where this situation is discussed in the FOM. I had never read it before. While it does state clearly that we needed to get a clearance time/void time; we didn't necessarily fit the exact parameters of either paragraph regarding closed tower operations; and the airport pages had no amplifying information; but; it is something that I could have been more familiar with. Additionally; although what we did was not directly in line with the FOM; I'm still not exactly sure if/how it was illegal. As far as I know we took off from Class E airspace in VMC and contacted ATC at 1;500 feet; never entering any controlled airspace. Lastly; and I've already fessed up to this; but I should have spoken up; plain and simple. There was that little bit of doubt in the back of my brain that said something wasn't quite right here but I chose to bury it and press. Being more assertive and a better communicator could have easily stopped this bit of Swiss cheese from aligning and allowing the outcome. A call to Dispatch or to NorCal would have been easy enough; and free; and I wouldn't have to spend all this time discussing my day.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I had the Captain look at the Engine Oil Temperature QRH. The checklist guides you to turn off the Autothrottle Arm switch; then retard the thrust lever of the affected engine with confirmation of the of the other pilot. The oil temperature reduced below the caution range. The QRH also guides you to make plans to land at the nearest suitable airport. By the time we were finished with the checklist we were climbing through 27;000 FT when the cockpit filled with smoke. Following the memory items for cockpit smoke we donned our oxygen masks and established crew communication. The Captain declared an emergency and requested to return to the departure airport. To stabilize the situation I engaged the autopilot. Then we selected the left engine bleed to OFF to see if it would clear the smoke and it worked. The smoke cleared quickly. Center vectored us for an ILS approach to the runway. The Captain requested landing performance information from Dispatch.

834,834,834,834,5028,Early afternoon; aircraft was taxing from the deicing pad to the runway. I was seated in forward jump-seat and aft Flight Attendant was standing in the forward galley when the fire alarm in the forward lavatory was activated. I stowed the jump-seat and the aft Flight Attendant opened the lavatory door to assess the fire alarm. Once the lavatory door was opened I sensed a burnt smell and saw smoke rising towards the ceiling of the aircraft. I contacted the flight deck. I notified them about the activated smoke alarm and possible fire. At that point I was asked if I saw smoke to which I replied 'yes;' I was not asked more details about cabin conditions. I called again and mentioned the need to evacuate passengers from the aircraft in case conditions worsen and was told to do an expedited deplaning. I got on the PA and stated 'Remain calm; we will be deplaning using the main cabin door; leave all of your personal belongings and exit the aircraft quickly.' The aft flight attendant walked to the aft of the aircraft once communicated that we would be doing an expedited deplaning. When the aircraft came to a complete stop I assessed outside conditions and open main cabin door. We commanded passengers to 'release seat belts; get out;' 'come this way; get out; go; go.' Some passengers were grabbing personal items from overhead bins so I commanded over the PA once again 'leave personal belongings and exit the aircraft.' I turned on emergency lights and continued deplaning. Half way through the deplaning process the fire alarm deactivated on its own. Passengers were calm. Then I heard the Captain over the PA state 'evacuate; evacuate; evacuate.' Most passengers were already out of the aircraft so we finished the expedited deplaning.Once everyone appeared to be out of the aircraft the aft Flight Attendant and I did a final walk through; checking lavatories. The First Officer came out of the flight deck and helped with getting passengers out of the aircraft. After grabbing some blankets we exited the aircraft. The First Officer and Flight Attendants worked together to gather passengers together outside. Fire trucks inspected the plane and police escorted passengers into the terminal. I didn't have a jacket so I was escorted into the terminal with passengers. Captain; First Officer; and aft Flight Attendant talked to the fire department.

837,837,837,837,4822,The winds were light and temp about 85F. It was normal approach and on-speed landing. After touch down; during taxi in; I noticed a brake temperature rising. The outboard rear left brake was much hotter than the others. It was reading 8 units and the others 3-5 (I now believe it was a stuck brake). I was alerted by Ramp Control that another aircraft saw a small brake fire. CFR responded; quickly assessed the brakes; and thought that an emergency evacuation was probably not required. I agreed and decided to defer an evacuation pending more info. They applied air to cool the brakes and extinguished the fire. We were towed to the gate after the brakes were cooled.My biggest concern; however; was the fact that when I thought I might have to evacuate; I reached for the old [Quick Response 'Checklist'] (QRC) on the glare shield. My muscle memory and 25 years of training at the company unconsciously brought me there. Fortunately; the event did not escalate into a full blown emergency. If it had and had I been in a heightened adrenalin state; I would most likely have had an even harder time finding the proper checklist. It was; of course; in the [newly introduced] [Quick Response 'Handbook'] (QRH) which is located in the flight bag. I was taught that once; in training conducted on a computer screen!Even after remembering the change; I still did not instinctively know where to go for the right page and the handbook format did not make it clear in which chapter I would find the appropriate checklist. Even after reviewing the new QRH periodically I had no real or simulated hands on experience with the handbook.My major point is that the recent training I received was grossly inadequate due to the lack of simulator training with enough repetition to counter years of muscle memory to build new habits and reactions. I now feel it is unquestionably dangerous to use web based training to train for such situations. The consequences could have been disastrous had it been a true emergency and I could not get to the checklist in a timely manner.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
838,838,838,838,10000,After takeoff at approximately 500 feet AGL both the First Officer and I heard a loud noise coming from the left side of the aircraft. I would describe the noise as a loud popping sound similar to what one would hear from a flag blowing in a sustained strong wind. I looked out my window and saw what I thought was a rope entangled in the number 1 propeller. The object blurred into a squiggly circle around the disc of rotation in a radius that was outside the intake. I am unsure if the popping noise was the object flapping in the airstream or it being slapped against the hull of the aircraft. I reported to Tower that we had an object entangled in the left prop; [requested priority handling]; and requested the ILS for return. Tower took the souls; the fuel; and coordinated the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) truck to meet the aircraft. Tower then handed us off to [Approach] for the ILS.I contacted the flight attendant and informed him we would be returning to the field in six minutes and that I had [requested priority handling] with ATC. We would not brace or evacuate. I would be stopping on the runway to shut down the engine and allow ARFF to examine the left side of the aircraft for any damage that would keep us from taxiing to the gate under our own power. The flight attendant said that was all the information he needed and would prepare the cabin for landing. By this point we were on downwind for the ILS. I would guess after about three minutes the object was thrown clear of the prop; the noise stopped; and I could no longer see the object in the propeller plane of rotation.After landing we stopped the aircraft and shut down number one. When the propeller stopped spinning I could see a piece of erosion tape about 8 inches hanging from one of the blades. It is my view that after takeoff a piece of tape; at least the length of half a propeller blade; separated down to the prop heater element at remained attached there. The loose material remained in the propeller plane of rotation until the spinning forces caused it to separate down to the 8 inch piece we saw after shutdown.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

840,840,840,840,3716,I was piloting a King Air A90 during skydive operations. I was single pilot. Preflight of the aircraft was normal and oil on both engines ran at 1 quart indicated cold. The before takeoff checklist/run up was complete as per the checklist.On the 5th load of the day after departing and while climbing out I experienced the smell of smoke in the cockpit at approximately 2000 feet. I was alerted by several of the skydive instructors that fire/smoke was coming from the right side. I confirmed the evidence smoke but no fire was present and it appeared to be outside the aircraft emanating from the right engine nacelle. I was unable to determine if the smell was electrical or petroleum based but I decided to shut down the right engine as per the memory items and return to the airport for landing. After the engine was shut I could no longer see evidence of smoke.After alerting approach that that I was returning to land due to a possible engine fire I changed frequency to CTAF. I positioned myself for final approach; and lowered the gear handle; but was unable to obtain 3 green. I saw the breaker for the landing gear was popped and reset the breaker and attempted to lower the gear again unsuccessfully. I aborted the approach. Smoke began to fill the cockpit again. I discussed the situation with the senior jump instructor and chose to climb the aircraft to 3000-3500 feet and allow the skydivers to exit above the minimum safe jump altitude. While climbing I completed the engine shutdown and secure checklist and asked the skydiver at the door to look to visually observe the gear and was informed the gear was half down at varying degrees. After completion of the engine shutdown checklist no further smoke was visible or could be smelled. Further; with the rear exit door open most of the smoke had vented from the cabin. I had the jumpers brief their exit and I performed the jump run. All jumpers exited the aircraft successfully without incident. After the jumpers exited I was able to control and climb the aircraft and began working the emergency gear down checklist. I was unable to successfully engage the clutch as per the procedure and felt no resistance on the manual gear handle as it was swung and asked for another King Air pilot to work the checklist over the radio. During this time several flight instruments failed.While loitering [in] the area I transferred fuel from the left wing to the left nacelle tank. After all options were exhausted and approximately 30 minutes of fuel remaining I briefed to myself a gear up landing and I executed the landing. The landing gear buckled upon landing but the aircraft remained on the runway and slid to a stop. I quickly performed the emergency shutdown memory items and evacuated. I was uninjured and learned all jumpers were uninjured.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

My major concern was she wore her mask as she entered the plane the forward Flight Attendant later informed me and kept it on up until we were in flight. I politely asked her to cover her nose with the mask and that's when she handed me the letter.In any event I know we have a procedure that passengers go through with medical and we should be notified on our departure report; nevertheless; I never want to be put in a situation like this again and my concerns are how to handle a situation like this in the near future.

842,842,842,842,8471,During preflight; taxi; and beginning of takeoff roll everything seemed to be operating normally. Upon applying power to 40 percent for takeoff all indications were normal. Aircraft veered slightly right so I applied left rudder to compensate and continued to add takeoff thrust. Aircraft continued to veer to the right. I applied continuous left rudder to compensate. Once I reached full rudder deflection (approximately 40 KTS); I aborted takeoff. I brought the aircraft to a stop and determined steering via tiller was operational and returned to gate. Once back in the gate Maintenance Control advised me that the Mechanic was on another aircraft so the delay would be unknown. We decided deplaning passengers would be the best option until we received further information.While deplaning a Passenger got very verbally abusive and threatening to myself and a flight attendant. Once all passengers were deplaned I informed the gate that the Passenger in question would not be continuing on our flight. He (Gate Agent) agreed and Gate Agent was enlisted to defuse the situation. Meanwhile the Mechanic was able to complete rudder inspection and determined there were no issues with rudder. The aircraft was signed off 'ops check good' and we were instructed to re board. Although the Mechanic had reservations and did not think the rudder was the root problem; Maintenance Control directed him to sign it off. So he did. While boarding Gate Agent notified me that the Passenger I had denied boarding was asking to apologize in hopes of being permitted to continue on this flight. As I was making my way to the gate this Passenger began to threaten and verbally abuse Gate Agent. At this point she (Passenger) was not permitted to speak with me and law enforcement was called. Law enforcement removed her from the gate. We continued to pushback. The ramp crew reengaged steering on ground service panel and departed. As I called for rudder check I noticed 'steer off' was no longer illuminated on the EICAS as it was prior to push. I then hit my steering disconnect switch and heard a grinding noise and felt vibration in the switch. I then asked the First Officer to try his steering disconnect switch. His did the same thing. We again returned to gate. Maintenance Control was again notified and Mechanic sent out. After much troubleshooting the steering was still inoperative and sporadic. It was finally determined that the microswitch in the tiller was inoperative and therefore steering did not disengage when tiller released for takeoff. Therefore we encountered a steering runaway situation on the takeoff roll with neither disconnect switch operational. Flight was subsequently cancelled and we were advised of a show time the next afternoon.

844,844,844,844,1308,In daylight cruise at FL400 near ZZZ1 we were deviating around a cell and entered a benign looking cloud with light radar return. The jumpseat rider noticed a flash and asked if it was lightning. First Officer and I had not noticed the flash or heard anything. Shortly thereafter I noticed a smell and asked anyone else noticed something that smelled like electrical fire. Jumpseater suggested it smelled more like caps with which the First Officer agreed. I picked up phone to check with Flight Attendants to find them already calling us to report smell in cabin. First Officer continued to fly and took over ATC communications while I started the Smoke/Fumes/Fire checklist. During checklist; Flight Attendants called with further reports and connected the start of the smell with light chop and a sound from the aft cargo bin that sounded like something shifting. Jumpseater was very helpful handling the calls from the cabin. We got as far as APU bleed off in the checklist; declared an emergency and advised ATC that we wanted to go to ZZZ. (We discussed ZZZ1 as a destination but given our altitude and distance required to descend elected to go for better maintenance support and customer service; with the ability to turn toward ZZZ1 in an emergency descent should the smoke not clear.)  We encountered some light chop and rain which was followed by autopilot and auto-throttle disengagement; and erratic ADC indications for a brief period. First Officer managed that problem while I continued with emergency checklist. That raised some concerns about potential for a serious electrical fire but when everything returned to normal operations and the smell diminished we elected to continue a normal descent for ZZZ. I made a PA to tell the passengers that we were working on a procedure to eliminate the source of the smell and proceeding to ZZZ as a precaution. Fumes dissipated quickly as we descended toward ZZZ. We requested emergency equipment and a thermal check of the cargo bins after landing. After landing we cleared the runway and stopped for inspection. Another PA was made to tell the passengers what was going on outside. Engines were alternately secured to allow crash personnel access to the fuselage; and the cargo bins were opened for inspection. After getting the all clear; we proceeded to the gate. I apologized to the passengers for getting them to the wrong airport but pointed out at least it was the right state.

846,846,846,846,1271,Two separate issues; both caused by mechanic problems. The window likely had a seal issue; but one that was excessive enough to cause concern and thus a decision to return to the Airport. The second issue; total icing system failure in icing conditions; was caused by something mechanical. Upon takeoff; we heard a loud noise coming from First Officer's (FO) window; indicating it wasn't sealed properly. We held pressurization and continued climb to 3000 MSL. We then had wing Anti Icing fail; followed by STAB and then Master Warning for anti-icing system fail. I continued to fly the aircraft and took the radios; and had FO run QRH to try to regain icing protection.

847,847,847,847,5944,I take what happened seriously and will see that it does not occur ever again in the future; but please bear with me as I explain what led up to the event with a backstory. I have recently started letting my hair grow out and - up until recently - had not needed the use of hair spray. On the flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 I stepped into the forward lavatory and saw that it needed grooming.  For the first time ever; after never having to use hairspray while on the airplane in my 32-plus years of flying; I retrieved my hairspray and returned to the lavatory. As I began grooming my hair with the hair spray I do not know if I had failed to recall or was simply unaware that there was the potential for that type of product to set off a lavatory smoke detector. Within a couple of seconds the alarm activated and it was then that I immediately recognized my mistake. I stepped out of the lavatory and quickly called the Captain who was also calling me. He told me the smoke alarm indicator lit up and I explained the situation to his satisfaction. I then pressed the reset button and the alarm ceased. Again; this was a first and one time incident and I will be more attentive and aware of my actions and conduct in the future so as to avoid repeating this mistake. I will review the section on hazardous materials in my Inflight Manual and; if necessary; add this event to my briefings to illustrate what can happen when one is not continuously vigilant of proper conduct on the aircraft.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
848,848,848,848,3431,As I was traveling in a experimental Lancair IV-PT pressurized aircraft; I experienced a cabin depressurization at FL240. I contacted center and requested 'Aircraft X needs to descend-lost pressurization'. I got no response; so I initiated a descent to 12;000FT. I then put on my oximizing cannula and opened the oxygen bottle valve. I then called Center again (sorry I can't remember the time interval) and got no response. I believe at FL190 I made third request for a lower altitude due to a loss of pressurization. I was having a difficult time keeping the cannula in my nose and thought at one point I was getting light headed. The controller asked if I wanted to declare an emergency; I replied 'no I now have my oxygen mask on'. The controller requested I turn right 30 degrees and ident; but in the challenge of keeping the cannula in my nose and flying the plane (at this point I realized the electric elevator trim servo was inoperative) I turned 30 degrees left and idented. The controller instructed me to continue a left turn back to my original heading and ident; which I did. The entire flight was in visual meteorological conditions.I descended down to 12;000FT and gained my composure. I then had time to anaylse the situation and thought the door seal was the culprit; (I had realized when the cabin depressurized I could hear the air leaving from the cabin door) but after bleeding the air from it I realized that wasn't the problem. I then looked further back and saw a 6 inch long crack in the aft upper cabin door window. Once I saw this I requested and received a 180 degree turn back to my departure airport.

849,849,849,849,4867,Early in boarding; ground air was unable to cool the plane; began using APU w/air conditioning packs. It began to drizzle; then outright downpour. Began smelling light oily fumes. I decided to call maintenance to have a mechanic check it out. I switched the left pack off; a little better; still smelled the oily fumes. Left pack back on; right pack off; worse. Tried to contact maintenance to consult about how long till mechanic would arrive & whether we should deplane; no answer; phone busy. Called Dispatch to get through to maintenance; both maintenance & dispatch busy due to multiple broken planes and weather events. Consulted with my First Officer (FO) & Flight Attendants (FA) and gate agents; then decided to deplane the passengers and crew.A mechanic arrived to run engines at idle at the gate in an effort to 'clean out' the ducts. FO sat in his seat (used oxygen mask); mechanic sat in LH seat; and I went into the terminal. The fumes smell filled last 2/3rds of the jetway on the way back to the plane (or; put another way - first 2/3rds on the way up to the terminal). After the engine run; the smell was less; but still present with the APU bleed off; and air coming from engine bleed. Maintenance wanted to defer the APU bleed and have us take the aircraft; using the engine bleeds for air conditioning. Not only is it too hot in ZZZ to use ground air in a A321; the smell was still present. I wanted them to run the engines at high power at the runup block to see if they could clear the fumes odor. The mechanic thought this was a good idea (was actually his idea); maintenance did not want to do this. My FO & I went downstairs to our Domicile Chief Pilot's office to tell him yes; we were refusing an 'airworthy' airplane because we didn't think it was safe for passengers nor crew to breathe the fumes. At some point after the engine run at idle at the gate; we opened ALL the cabin doors; to discuss the situation with the mechanics. Despite sitting in a cabin seat row adjacent to open mid-cabin doors; my FO and I felt lightheaded and had low-grade headaches.We later decided it would not be prudent to operate an aircraft and that we were no longer fit for duty. We informed our Domicile Chief Pilot (who contacted scheduling). I talked to a few of our FA's about the situation; then we went home.There is a backstory; which I only realized after going home and checking my own flight history.(1) Same airplane - I flew this aircraft and wrote up an oily fumes smell.(2) Same weather - I flew an A319 and got an oily fumes smell.It is my belief that [this aircrafts] APU has been leaking slowly for a long time; and that the oil has accumulated in the packs or filters in aerodynamically quiet areas. It is then released with power/thrust changes or; as in our case; with the introduction of lots of moisture/humidity from the heavy rain outside. I am not aware of rain prior to [this] event; but it was present for the [other] event.After we left; another crew was called to do the flight. Apparently; they refused it because of the fumes odor still present. A third crew took the plane the next day and wrote it up in because of the fumes odor. Maintenance actions in between those event included running the engines more; a finding that the APU was over serviced; and replacing cabin air filters.A discussion with the mechanic during our event revealed that he (and likely maintenance as well) believed that he thought it was difficult to find the fumes source; and uncertain on what the next steps should be; other than defer the APU bleed. I explained that the 'Airbus technical magazine #52' explains very clearly EXACTLY what to do. It is not a maintenance manual; nor is it for the A320 series alone. It outlines logical steps to follow on ANY Airbus aircraft; to (1) find the source; (2) fix the problem; and (3) clean the ducts/packs to keep the fumes from reoccurring.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
850,850,850,850,3866,Approximately 5 to 10 minutes after reaching cruising altitude of 15;000ft; the Captain (the non-flying pilot) said 'smells like something is burning.' I (the First Officer/flying pilot) did not recognize the smell. But after 2 to 3 minutes; I smelled something and said 'smells like an oven toaster.' But there was neither a master warning nor caution lights on and all gauges indicated normal conditions. We noticed faint smoke in the cockpit but couldn't tell where the smoke came from. Then; we heard the smoke detector in the lavatory and the Captain asked the Flight Attendant if she saw any smoke. She replied that there was faint smoke in the cabin also. We put on the oxygen masks; did the emergency check list; declared the emergency to ATC and descended to 10;000ft. We decided to return to our departure airport since the initial smoke was faint and had completely disappeared after we turned off the bleed air (depressurization flight). We determined that since there was no further smoke or smell; the smoke detector alarm had ceased; there was no master warning or any other caution lights; all gauges indicated normal operation and the aircraft appeared to be operating normally that there was no need for special assistance for landing and no need to evacuate the aircraft upon our return. We landed at our departure airport. The next day I spoke with the mechanic who fixed the airplane which we were on. He found that one of the compressor blades of the Air Cycle Machine was broken; causing a small oil leak. The oil was burning and the air to inside the airplane contained that smoke.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

A FA then asked me when I was doing my walk thru to see if she was complying with her request and I said sure. On my way back to my galley I observed passenger XX1 sitting with her mask off. Since this was the second time I used the last approach to try to get her to comply. I spoke with her about her mask she said she couldn't wear it because she was drinking coffee I said I understand but as the announcement states if she isn't actively drinking she has to replace her mask. She then pulled her mask up and said this is ridiculous. I walked back to my galley and informed my A FA that I had spoken with her again about her mask because she had removed it again.

852,852,852,852,3959,Immediately after takeoff from ZZZ; I was sitting in back as the B position Flight Attendant and I smelt fumes that I had never smelled in my entire career before. I jumped out of my jump seat to investigate where the origin of the fumes may be coming from and looked out passenger window to make certain the engines were not on fire even though this smell was not of that nature. I didn't see anything. I did not see any smoke. I tried to locate the source of fumes by smelling the vents in galley and lavatory as well but found nothing. I looked to forward cabin and noticed the C Flight Attendant motioning me to pick up the handset. I picked up the handset and she told me she smelled fumes up front cabin as well. With the two of us on the handset we called the Captain and he also confirmed that the pilots both smelled the fumes up in cockpit as well. He told us if the fumes got any worse; to call him back. Within a minute or two later I couldn't breathe in the back cabin and was chugging water to keep my throat open to even breathe. I also got wet paper towels to cover my nose and mouth even though I could not see fumes. My throat and chest were burning; and I had a pounding headache and was coughing profusely. I immediately called the Captain and told him what was happening; and he told me that they were already in an [priority] landing pattern back into ZZZ and it would be another 5-10 before we were back on the ground. Before our Captain made an announcement to our passengers; I noticed that some of our passengers had emergency briefing cards already in their laps. We were back on ground in ZZZ about 10 minutes later. We stopped abruptly on the runway and were surrounded by many emergency vehicles. Our Captain made announcements to all passengers to remain seated loudly 4 times and listen to the commands of the flight attendants. We ended up going back to gate and deplaning all passengers at gate. The Fire Department came onboard and checked out the aircraft after we exited the aircraft. As a crew we all were feeling horrible and many symptoms and all the same symptoms simultaneously. Headache; nausea; burning in throat; burning in chest; dizziness; faint; shortness of breath; coughing; numbness in extremities; etc. Our Captain had the entire crew pulled from the flight duties and we all went to the hospital together to get checked out medically for anything we may have ingested as far as fumes that were making us feel so poorly. I do not know how the passengers were treated in regards to this situation. I commend the Captain and First Officer both on how they handled this situation.

855,855,855,855,3244,At FL340 First Officer and myself were seated at our duty stations. We heard what sounded like something impacting the aircraft. We both noticed that the windshield on my side was shattered with a brown tar looking substance on the outside. I noted there was no cabin pressure indication however I instructed First Officer to put her mask and goggles on as did I. I did not know what had happened and never experienced this before in the fifteen years as a Captain on this fleet. My first thoughts and concern was to get to a lower habitable altitude in the unlikely event the aircraft had suffered other damage or the windshield might fail completely. I declared an emergency with ATC for a lower altitude. I did broadcast a brief description with the Controller what was taking place. At FL240 I ask for a checklist from the QRH and to plot the nearest suitable airport. After completing the checklist I felt the windshield did have some type of electrical failure. I then called to the back and brought up First Officer who was on a crew rest. I also briefed the Purser to the situation and gave consideration to landing at the nearest field. I then contacted Maintenance through Dispatch via SATCOM. Maintenance felt comfortable with our description and information and agreed that it was electrical failure of the outer pane. I advised ATC that we had talked with our Company and our checklist indicate that we able to continue to our planned destination. For fuel reasons I requested FL300 and .78 mach. I did explain to ATC that I did not need emergency handling that my intent was to declare an emergency to descend because of the unknown issue with the windshield. I felt it better to get to an altitude that was VFR on top and run our checklist. I had never seen an event with a windshield and my main concern was for the safety of the passengers; aircraft and crew. My responsibility is safety first. Declaring an emergency maybe viewed by others as premature; but looking through a completely shattered outer pane required a split second decision which I stand by solely. First Officer landed the aircraft as my visibility was less than acceptable for a normal operation.

856,856,856,856,9195,I did not witness passenger boarding as I was working in the aft of the cabin. The passenger was boarded with an aisle chair and apparently needed 3 assistants. He was traveling with his wife (?) Mrs. X.After takeoff I noticed Ms. X was feeding him. Later I was told by other crew members that she had changed his diaper on the passenger seat. He was unable to stand or even move himself to a sitting position from laying on the seat. She was unable to move him or help him in the bathroom.This seems an unsafe condition for him to be unable to use a bathroom for a 15 hour flight. It seems unsanitary to change a diaper in the passenger seat. It seems unsanitary and unfair to have other passengers have to share the area with the smells of human urine and feces for such a long flight.In hind sight I wish we had contacted [customer service] during boarding to determine if it was acceptable for him to travel. He needed one or two or more strong people traveling with him to be able to get him in the aisle chair and help him in the bathroom. That might not have worked either.The flight had been delayed and we were hurrying to leave and the passenger's level of disability was unclear to flight attendants.

857,857,857,857,8168,As SIC PNF (Second in Command; Pilot Not Flying) I was tasked with the cockpit duties. Getting the jet / cockpit ready for flight. All that that entails. I'm good at it; I like it. Very close to 40 minutes after entering the cockpit the 'cockpit' was ready to go fly. For a trip from ZZZ to [our international destination] it takes about that length of time. I did everything; I am very meticulous. Talk is cheap; I know.  I checked the route; I checked the SID; 1500 foot altitude restriction; I set up the noise abatement profile; I set up the ETP (Equal Time Point); etc; etc; ...I use a personal checklist to make sure I set up the cockpit correctly and completely. I am positive the [correct SID] departure was in the box; positive. Now; you probably have doubt but I'm telling you it was in there; period. We were busy with passengers; luggage; etc. right before engine start. This may be important; on international flights the clearance is only available 30 minutes prior to actual departure. On domestic flights it is available an hour prior to actual departures via [Company] scheduling. I received the clearance via CPDLC and there was an INSERT MOD of PUT. I accomplished entering the mod and checked route page that PUT had inserted correctly. I accomplished this just prior to passengers arriving. Everything is fine / normal. Loaded the luggage; started the engines; taxied; and pulled onto runway; and took off. All normal. Obviously not. I had checked the full route and SID prior to obtaining the CPDLC MOD clearance. Like an hour prior. I checked the MOD as I stated; but I did not recheck the whole route; why would I.The PIC (Pilot in Command) was inside FBO doing PIC duties. We did not check route together. But that is not unusual; again I am positive the [correct SID] was loaded; 1500 foot altitude restriction (NAV /VNAV).We were cleared for takeoff rather quickly; but not super fast. I had zero reason to think that we were not 100% ready to go. The PIC had briefed the noise abatement profile back in the chocks and I added that 1900 VSI would not be necessary because we would already be in ALT CAP; level off mode. Normal for the [departure]. On departure I noticed and verbalized that I did not see ALT CAP happening and to level off at 1500 feet. The standard departure SOP has the PNF looking at the altimeter a lot; very much oriented around altitude versus ground track. The PIC called for autopilot and of course tower switched us to departure control and the PIC said something to the effect of is the SID loaded. I don't know what he said but when I looked down at the MAP display we were driving into space on runway heading. No [SID]!First: when the jet receives a CPDLC clearance with a mod does that drop out the SID? I have no idea. I have had plenty of those type of clearances but cannot remember the specifics. Two: The charts had been 'updated' by Maintenance the previous night. I had to select proper date page out of ZZZ. Maybe that have had something to do with it? When we checked on with Departure Control they gave us a heading and climb right away which is kind of normal. They also said to fly the SID next time. I stated that it dropped out of the box on gear retraction. I had no reason to believe it was not in the box. I had no other answer; that is what I thought happened. I had checked it an hour or so ago. I am positive it was in the FMS way back during cockpit set up but prior to receiving CPDLC mod clearance.I have two recommendations: The go around call of flaps 6 spoilers zero should be changed. The spoilers zero means nothing to 99% of the crews. The callout has been diluted so bad it is meaningless. What does that have to do with anything? This; as an SOP we are to verbalize the 1st waypoint prior to takeoff. Most of the time we have to hunt for the waypoint because it is 10; 20; 30 miles away... meaningless. Change the SOP to RNAV departures only. That first fix is within 3-5 miles of the runway; important. That will help us emphasize that we are doing an RNAV departure and it is a little out of the ordinary. ZZZ1 and other airports make you read back first RNAV fix in takeoff clearance. Today the PIC may have; probably did; verbalize the first waypoint but I have the [SID] memorized and since it is an everyday sop his response did not draw me in as we were taking the runway and I was busy with all the other sops. There certainly is something to having so many sops that they become diluted; lose their importance. Maybe we have crossed the line just a bit. Without question; I pride myself in knowing the SOPs. But after I have verbalized the SOP am I really giving it the thought intended. No; I probably am not. Just some thoughts. I am not trying to change [Company]; I am not bucking the [Company] philosophy (I know my SOPs); just a couple of thoughts. We screwed up; obviously; BUT when did the [SID] drop out of the FMS. Seriously; I have no idea. Do you? Was it the MOD insert in the clearance? I need to know. We may have a few too many SOPs. They may have become diluted.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

861,861,861,861,8052,After pushback from our gate; we started engines and were ready to taxi.  ATC cleared us to taxi  via Z; G; and Y.  As we started to taxi; the First Officer and I cleared our respective sides and began to taxi. We were on Z and; as we started to approach G; we cleared left and right again.  No other aircraft was seen and no information regarding any other traffic was given by ATC.   We started our turn onto G to join Taxiway Y and; as we started to turn; the First Officer saw another aircraft approaching on Y with a high closure rate and he said; 'Stop. Stop.'  I could not see what he was seeing as that area is blind from my seat. I quickly and firmly applied the brakes and brought the aircraft to a stop. At this time; the other aircraft called Ground and asked if they should give way to us and stopped as well. The Controller was confused and I have serious doubts that he even saw the conflict. At this time; I was contacted by the cabin and informed that a Flight Attendant had fallen in the cabin. We notified ATC that we were stopped and were not moving so we could check on the Crew in the cabin.  The other aircraft continued to their gate. Our Flight crew informed me that the 'A' Flight Attendant had fallen; but was OK and the cabin was OK. We taxied out to 30 and I asked ATC what had happened with the taxi clearance.  He admitted that we had not done anything wrong; the mistake was his; and that he had mistaken the distance between the aircraft. The Ground Controller had issued the other carrier a clearance to taxi to their gate after clearing the runway and also issued us a clearance to taxi for departure. He had misjudged the time it would take to get to the same space on the taxiway that he cleared us both to be on.

Upon contacting Houston approach I requested an altitude of 3;500 feet (which would have potentially taken me into Class Bravo airspace) and a direct route to [my intended destination] with Flight Following. I was cleared to 3;500 feet and given a few vectors then told to resume own navigation and was cleared direct to [my intended destination]. About half way to [my intended destination] my passenger was not feeling well so we decided to abort the flight and return to KSGR. I informed approach that we wanted to return to KSGR and was asked to make a right 180 degree turn and then cleared direct to KSGR at or Below 3;000 feet the controller made a comment that I was 'right in the middle of the approach corridor to Houston Hobby' I do not think I actually breached the class Bravo airspace without permission or without being vectored into it by approach however I do not remember actually getting formal permission to enter the airspace. The channel was busy and I may have missed it. I just wanted to be on the safe side in case I inadvertently misunderstood my clearance. At no time was I told by ATC that I was in violation of the airspace nor was I asked to contact anyone upon the conclusion of the flight.

863,863,863,863,6499,We taxied out to Runway XXL in ZZZ without any incident.  Takeoff was normal with normal indications.  We weighed 170;000 LBS and had almost full tanks of gas with a full load of passengers heading to ZZZ1.  Shortly after takeoff the Captain asked if I smelled anything.  I replied; 'Yes.'  It was not the normal galley/food smell; high heat smell or electrical burning smell; but more of a burning oil smell.  I associated it with the possible factories that we fly over in the ZZZ area.  The Captain called the flight attendants to see if they smelled it and they also smelled it in the back of the cabin.  Once the Captain heard this; he said that we were going to return to ZZZ.  I put my mask on and established communication (comm) and the Captain did as well.  ATC asked if we were declaring an emergency and the Captain responded; 'Yes.'  The Captain ran the checklist and I put the autopilot on and began the decent back to ZZZ for a landing on XXL.  We were only about 20 miles from the airport when we began the return.  My thought process was to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible and the Captain seemed to be the same. He ran as quickly as possible through the Smoke/Odor/Fumes Checklist while I set up for a 40-Flap max brakes; overweight landing.  We came back together on Final and ran through the Approach/Descent; Approach Checklist and set up to land.  After landing we called the flight attendants to see if they saw or smelled any more odors.  They did not and we proceeded to the gate.

868,868,868,868,10082,Placement of the permanent EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) mount causes the bottom part of the iPad to extend into the area needed to freely operate the tiller and the yoke. This restricts the pilot's ability to use the flight controls and severely restricts turning the tiller and yoke to the right. We verified proper seated position in accordance with [manual guidance] which places the pilot in a slightly higher seated position. This in fact exacerbates the problem by raising forearm position and reducing clearance between left forearm and the base of the iPad. The solution that I utilize is removing the iPad from its mount during all ground operations and any critical inflight operation to include taxi; takeoff; departure; climb; approach; and landing.

869,869,869,869,7036,Prior to flight; Crew Oxygen system gauge read 800+ psi. Both CA and FO successfully accomplished Oxygen System check IAW FM. Flight was normal until 1:45 into flight at FL380 when we planned to take a restroom break. The FO discovered his oxygen mask had no flow. I checked mine; discovering the same thing. Further inspection revealed the Crew Oxygen gauge read Zero. We checked the QRH; discovering no guidance on this malfunction. Though no current issue existed; we were concerned about a potential cabin altitude problem or rapid depressurization; so we coordinated a descent to lower altitude while we discussed continuing to destination or diversion. A quick review of the FOM and FM revealed no guidance on this particular malfunction. We ultimately decided we needed to get to 10;000 feet since we had no emergency back-up source of crew oxygen. We needed 5.9 fuel at destination and FMC said we should land with 6.4 after uploading current winds. The TAF for ZZZ1 said we should have 6nm 8 SCT 15 BKN; which was also the current METAR. We coordinated with Dispatch; he confirmed we should land with 6.4 and could find no guidance against continuing to original destination. We briefed the FAs; but not the passengers (our descent was gradual; it was night with under cast and we thought it would be on social media immediately upon landing. No passenger commented on being at lower altitude during the remainder of flight or during deplaning). We also sent an ACARS message to Maintenance Control about the problem and made a logbook entry (we did not get a response from Maintenance Control).

874,874,874,874,9484,As Pilot Flying; we were on final approach to ILS 30 ZZZ. Winds were called at 320/23G33. There were current reports of significant windshear on final with winds shifting from a tailwind to a headwind. Just below 1;000 feet; the amber WINDSHEAR warning was displayed on the PFD and shortly after the airspeed increased significantly enough to destabilize the approach and I made the decision to go around. Because of the significant storm sitting in the path of the missed approach procedure we had precoordinated with Tower that we would be turning east away from the storm in the event of a go around. During cleanup and climb out with the sudden increase of airspeed the flaps speed limits for flaps 30 were exceeded with a top speed of 173 knots. We were offered an approach to [Runway] XXL at ZZZ which we initially accepted but requested to hold so that we could properly set up for the approach while at the same time approach control advised us of the winds (which were still the same) and were out of limits. We elected to hold on the final approach course to the RNAV XXL and wait to see if the storm causing the effects would possibly move out. While holding I asked my Relief Pilot to coordinate with Dispatch if ZZZ1 could be used as our alternate considering that I would need a maintenance flap inspection and I knew that ZZZ1 maintenance personnel were highly experienced with the 767 fleet. We were provided both ZZZ2 and ZZZ1 information. Our filed alternates were ZZZ3 which was in the path of this storm and ZZZ4 which was on the other side of the line of storms. Dispatch was in concurrence and we obtained clearance to ZZZ1. We were subsequently cleared to ZZZZZ4 arrival. After departure from holding; I asked my First Officer to declare minimum fuel until landing. We were offered our choice of runways and landed on [Runway] XYL. Our parking location given was Spot X. We could not locate that on any JEPP chart and ended up asking Ground Control if they could tell us where Spot X was. They also did not know where Spot X was nor did our Ramp Control. Ground Control eventually found out and gave us taxi instructions to a remote; uncontrolled location on the west side of the airport. We parked the brakes and shut down. I began making DOT announcements; notified [Maintenance Control] thru Dispatch of such; and attempted coordinating with [Company] Ops for our maintenance needs. No one came to the aircraft or brought airstairs. One hour later; we were assigned Gate X (international gate); and had to restart engines and taxi back across the airport. Final parking time after an additional 30 minute [for] jetbridge malfunction was. I continued DOT announcements (excluding the opportunity to deplane because Customs and Border Protection would not clear anyone to leave the aircraft.) Coordination was accomplished with Maintenance and other [Company] ground personnel for us to begin the preflight process to return to ZZZ. As we waited for Maintenance sign off; with the cabin temps rising I continued announcement updates trying to coordinate for ground air support. As the 4 hr DOT deadline approached; I was advised by the cabin crew that the passengers in the back of the plane were becoming unruly and angry in the over 80 degree temps. Water services had been made as well as delay snack kits exhausted. The logbook was not here yet and I did not know how much longer; but ground personnel advised that 'it was close'. At that point; we were also approaching our MOT and I made the decision to terminate the flight and attempt to deplane the passengers. I continued status announcements awaiting Customs and Border Protection's clearance to deplane. During this additional wait; I was given reports of passengers fainting and children with bloody noses. Not knowing how much longer it would be before release by Customs and Border Protection; I asked the [Company] Agent to please call for paramedics to tend to the passenger health issues being reported.  Customs and Border Protection released the passengers at approximately 4.5 hours after landing at ZZZ1. Flap over speed was caused by extreme weather anomalies. The DOT exceedance was directly related to inadequate support by Ground Personnel.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I took control of radios and told Tower we have smoke in aircraft. He said he was rolling the trucks. As I taxied the smoke became much thicker and started to overtake the cockpit. I stopped straight ahead and ordered an evacuation of the aircraft out the left side and to meet at the nose of the aircraft. My IRO blew the slide. My First Officer started to look for the evacuation checklist but I instructed him to leave the aircraft and I ran some of the checklist from memory. I set parking brake; shut down all three engines and blew the bottles to the engines. We all evacuated the aircraft and when we met at the nose of the aircraft Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting was just arriving. We had no known hazmat on aircraft.

878,878,878,878,4133,We pulled the aircraft out of a heated hangar at our home base and immediately applied Type IV anti-ice fluid to the aircraft. I briefed the line service technician on the procedure and told him that we wanted the fluid applied to the wings and tail; being sure to stay away from the APU intake; windshield; and probes. I supervised the application and didn't see anything amiss other than application of some fluid to the side of the fuselage at window level. After a final tactile inspection; I boarded the aircraft and started the APU immediately and performed all standard pre-flight checklists. We started the engines normally and saw no abnormal indications. The taxi was normal and we briefed the take-off on a contaminated runway. All necessary computations were completed and we proceeded into position on Runway 34. The take-off roll was uneventful until just after rotation. Immediately after rotation and less than 50 FT AGL I noticed that smoke was entering the cockpit. I notified the Captain and we both immediately donned our oxygen masks. I then notified the Tower and declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit. We continued the climb to a safe altitude as briefed; but the smoke rapidly worsened. Visibility in cockpit was estimated at 10-12 inches for a period of approximately 90 seconds. Due to the low visibility and ceiling we were unable to maintain visual contact with the ground and entered the clouds. The Captain turned the aircraft to enter a left downwind and proceeded towards the ILS approach. As the Captain maintained control of the aircraft I began the Smoke/Fire checklist. The smoke was beginning to dissipate somewhat and I shut down the APU and Air Conditioning Packs. This improved the situation and almost all of the smoke was out of the cockpit. We continued to the ILS approach and landed uneventfully. After landing the fire department assured us there was no smoke or fire visible from outside and we decided to exit the runway at that time. No damage was done to the aircraft and a post-flight inspection by our maintenance department confirmed this. To the best of our knowledge; we believe that some of the Type IV anti-ice fluid entered the APU inlet upon aircraft rotation. This fluid then 'burned' through the APU and caused a great amount of smoke to enter the cabin and cockpit. Our recommendation in the future; if anti-ice application takes place; will be to take-off with the APU Load Control Valve (LCV) OFF to prevent smoke or fumes from entering the cabin in the event that TYPE IV fluid is ingested into the APU.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
879,879,879,879,6924,While climbing through FL210 to FL220 we noticed the number 2 engine ITT (Inter Turbine Temperature) rising. We stopped our climb and asked ATC for FL200. While descending to FL200 the right engine VIB (Vibration) icon appeared. Our FA (Flight Attendant) called up and asked what was going on; I told him; 'we are working on a problem and will be landing soon. I do not have a time at the moment.' We reduced the thrust to near or at idle. I told ATC that we were having engine problems. ATC gave us a lower altitude. Then we received a FWD and AFT LAV Smoke warning messages. We smelled smoke. We decided to switch controls from FO (First Officer) flying to CA (Captain) flying. The FO ran the R Engine Oil abnormal procedure checklist. It was the only EICAS message that was most prevalent at the time; other than the FWD and AFT LAV smoke messages. We decided to secure the engine first then assess the LAV situations. After the engine was secured; the LAV smoke messages went away. I told the passengers that we will be landing soon and that we had multiple problems with the aircraft. The FO did notify the FA's that we would be emergency landing in 10 minutes. We ran the single engine procedures checklist and then the descent checklist and the landing checklist appropriately.

Approach had cleared us down to 6;000 feet and as we were passing through 10;000 I started the APU in anticipation of deplaning at a hard stand.  As I started the APU I picked up the checklist to finish the approach check and when I glanced back at the EICAS I noticed the APU had hung around 55%. As I reached up and pressed the stop button the APU fire warning appeared. We were approximately 10 minutes from landing and were briefed and set up for the visual landing into ZZZ. As I discussed the situation with the First Officer I ran the QRH APU Fire In-flight checklist. At the completion of the checklist all indications showed the fire had been extinguished.  I decided that we would continue into ZZZ. The First Officer prompted me to advise the Tower; I then declared an emergency and had Tower scramble Fire and Rescue. I also advised the Flight Attendant of the situation.  The aircraft was exhibiting no problems and we were anticipating on a normal landing; but I wanted her ready to evacuate if need be.  Tower cleared us for XXR and we landed normally and pulled off onto the taxiway.  The First Officer requested the fire trucks to inspect our tail section for any sign of smoke or fire; while they did so he advised the passengers of the situation explaining the presence of the airport fire personnel to allay any concern they may have. We were given the all clear and taxied to the gate without incident and the passengers deplaned.I would suggest in this situation; stay calm and run the appropriate QRH.

884,884,884,884,5341,With our new pre-departure takeoff procedures; where we DO NOT brief takeoff performance; the flying First Officer DID NOT brief the takeoff performance. This is our new SOP. At the start of the takeoff roll; the Captain selected TO/GA; the throttles advanced normally with THR REF annunciated on the PFD; and the EPR settled on 1.37; with 90 % N1. I mentioned from the secondary relief seat that that was not enough thrust. The three First Officers all noticed immediately that this was not enough thrust for a normal reduced thrust takeoff. The flying First Officer immediately grabbed the performance data printout; read the thrust requirements to himself (1.46 EPR and 96 % N1; and advanced the throttles to the proper setting for our takeoff at roughly 820;000 LBS with flaps 20. The cause of the initial improper setting was that the flying First Officer; when selecting a reduced thrust temperature; inadvertently selected 54 degrees; which resulted in 53 degrees being displayed on the upper EICAS for the reduction. The correct number was 39 degrees from the performance data. This error happened as he read across on the performance data line and saw: 39 54/67/77; where 54 really means 154 KTS for V1; 67 means 167 KTS for rotation; and 77 means 177 KTS for V2.

888,888,888,888,8055,On short final; we were able to hear the Flight Attendant Passenger call button go off. Shortly thereafter the Flight Attendant called the flight deck. I answered the Flight Attendant's call (I was First Officer and Pilot Flying). The Flight Attendant attempted to tell me twice what the problem was; but I had to turn the intercom volume up to full in order to hear him. On his third attempt he stated that the passenger at seats 10 A and B were reporting smoke in the cabin. I asked him if there was smoke and he said yes and it was making its way up the aisle. Since we were so close to landing; I told him ok; we will be on the ground in minutes. I then informed the Captain of the situation; we immediately declared an emergency; and when asked; had Tower roll the emergency trucks. We turned the packs off; the Captain landed the aircraft and pulled off onto the first high speed available to us. At that time we called the Flight Attendant to find out the status of the cabin. The Flight Attendant reported that the smoke had stopped and had disappeared. We proceeded to taxi to the gate; but at the Fire Marshal's request; we stopped the aircraft and allowed them to board and access the situation. Once they were sure that we were ok; we proceeded to the gate with a fire escort. During deplaning; a nonrev/deadhead Flight Attendant who had been on board told me that she had seen the 'smoke' on takeoff and thought that it had been condensation from the air conditioning then and during landing. Also; we had taken off with the APU running and Packs on the APU due to the hot temperatures that day. Shortly before the passenger notifying the Flight Attendant of smoke; we had started the APU and swapped the Packs to it over for landing. Maintenance personnel were notified and inspected the aircraft; APU; Packs and engines and could find nothing wrong. They signed the aircraft back into service. This led us to believe that it was in Flight Attendant condensation from the air conditioner. Also; on our next flight; the Flight Attendant informed us after landing that he had received further complaints from the new passenger. After the aisle cleared of deplaning passenger I could see what looked like fog 'rolling' down the aisle. This was inflight condensation. There was just an unusual amount being produced such that it looked like a fog machine on a stage. At no time did anyone report any unusual smells. Also; the aircraft behind us was instructed to discontinue their approach and go missed by the Tower. Aircraft produced unusual amount of condensation; such that it looked like smoke in the aisles. Flight Attendant was new - he has only been with the company for one month and had not yet seen condensation in the aircraft. However; he did make the best call to inform us of the situation so we could have fire personnel meet the aircraft.

890,890,890,890,2516,Shortly before landing; the cabin area around the 3L and 3R doors smelled strongly like vomit or sweaty feet/old socks. I covered my nose with my necktie at the 3R jumpseat. I had taken my jumpseat about 3-5 minutes before landing after I had completed my final safety checks. That's when I noticed the smell. I deliberated for a moment about whether to call the pilots during sterile cockpit or whether to let them know on the ground. I decided on the latter. I failed to call the purser before touchdown and inform him of the smell. I had smelt something similar but much less intense during takeoff and had not found it noteworthy then. As far as I am aware; there was no such smell in coach during the flight. None of the passengers in the area seemed sick; no one from the crew was aware of any passenger having thrown up. After landing; before I could take the issue further; a debriefing by the captain in first class was announced. I couldn't hear much of what he was saying because by the time I arrived he was talking to station mechanics. Apparently; during the flight; that same smell had gone to nearly unbearable extremes inside the cockpit. The copilot later on the remote gate shuttle bus explained that they had several times considered diverting the flight. This was the first time I heard of that. I asked the purser on the bus if he had known of any of this in flight. He said no. There was also talk on the bus that one of the auxiliary power units had failed in flight. I had not heard of that before either. I was not asked by any of the pilots in flight if there was a strange smell in the (economy) cabin; nor am I aware that anyone of my coach coworkers was consulted. Inside the terminal; I went to a restroom because I felt the unusual urge to blow my nose; clear my throat and spit out the saliva several times. I drove home in my car after the flight and stopped 20 minutes later at an autobahn restaurant due to a headache. After some research at home; I am concerned that I have been exposed to (TCP) contaminated; toxic bleed air through the air conditioning system on today's flight. I would like to be informed what the exact findings (by maintenance or whoever is in charge) were as to why a severe smell was present in the cockpit and in the cabin on today's flight and what has been done about the incident.

894,894,894,894,5737,This was the second leg of a two leg day. I was the pilot flying. The flight experienced issues immediately after takeoff as the autothrottles were not responding to the thrust management computer. As the issue was not immediately serious; the throttles were flown manually to altitude where the malfunction could be assessed. Subsequently the thrust management computer failed. We complied with checklist guidance and prepared the aircraft for descent as the flight was very short. Hand flying of the throttles was required and close attention to airspeed control required higher than normal pilot flying attention. During the SID descent and approaching 10;000 FT; the Approach Controller cleared us to the VOR; a fix not on the flight plan or SID. The pilot not flying asked for the phonetics. The pilot not flying heard the wrong phonetics and thought the clearance was to another VOR. The pilot not flying is of international descent and has an accent which may have contributed to the communication error. The error was not noticed by the either the pilot flying or the Controller in the read back. Initially the turn direction seemed odd to me. We briefly discussed it and the pilot not flying explained and showed what he did. Since my mind was overly focused on airspeed control I did not recognize the error (at the time of the error I was focusing the majority of my attention to on airspeed control as we were transitioning airspeed as we passed through 10;000 FT). I also believe a minor amount of duty time fatigue dulled my ability to properly assess the error. We turned in the direction of the wrong fix. The Controller queried us and the error became immediately apparent to all of us. The Controller vectored us on the remainder of the approach. No other issues occurred but the increased workload from the thrust management computer inoperative in the cockpit was noticeable.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
895,895,895,895,1994,The flight was the first after a completed annual inspection to home base. Filed IFR. After normal VFR takeoff and climb out; contacted approach for filed IFR routing. Received routing and proceeded northbound on course at 5000 ft.  Shortly thereafter; I noted the electric pitch trim did not work.  The STEC 30 autopilot system did not seem to be managing the very light turbulence situation with noticeable altitude deviations.  About 5 minutes later I observed no charging on the ammeter; and a popped alternator circuit breaker.  I reset the circuit breaker and noted an abnormally high ammeter reading. The circuit breaker quickly popped again.  I contacted Approach; advised of the problem; cancelled the IFR flight plan; and advised continuation of the flight to my filed destination. I attempted another reset with same high ammeter reading and detected a slight whiff of electrical smoke. The CB had not popped within that 3-5 second window; so I secured the electrical system with the Battery switch.  I pulled out a handheld radio from my flight kit and hooked it into my headset.  Navigation was combination visual and Garmin Pilot app on an iPad mini. I contacted FSS requesting a clearance waiver into my destination due to no transponder; and limited communication. FSS contacted ARTCC; and advised.  I switched over to their frequency; and was advised my request was approved.  Depending on where I was and the controller's receiver antenna made it sometimes difficult for them to hear me; but I could hear them and used mic clicks to acknowledge their queries. Tower cleared me to land on runway 10R about 8 miles from touchdown. On the ground I was able 2 way radio comm with ground control. Taxied to parking uneventfully.My error was a second attempt at CB reset.  The OEM aircraft circuit breaker was not one you can manually pull out yourself.  Had I not done that and then needed to immediately secure the whole system with the battery master switch; I could have used aircraft battery power for communication and transponder.During the annual inspection; the A&P had replaced a damaged cushion clamp on alternator wiring in the engine bay.  The post maintenance action engine run up was uneventful.  Conjecture is that during the course of the cushion replacement action; a potential ground in a related area was unseated; and vibrated it's way to a short inflight.  Troubleshooting will be focused in this area next week.

He told me that the Flight Attendant said power had been removed from the oven and the fire had been contained in the oven. They also said the wall was very hot. The Captain also said the Flight Attendant said there was smoke; but it had dissipated. The Flight Attendant called back again and told the Captain there was no fire or smoke now; but the passengers' meals were ruined. After that call; the Captain and I ran an un-annunciated checklist. We ran the checklist with first; the understanding that the power to the oven had been removed and second; under the impression that currently there was no longer smoke; fire; or fumes.Very shortly; if not immediately after completing the checklist; the Flight Attendant called back up and said the wall and oven were very; very hot. With that information; the Captain asked that the flying copilot be woken from break and to come to the cockpit. The flying copilot came to the cockpit to get a quick briefing. The Captain updated him and asked that he go back to the aft galley to assess the situation. Shortly thereafter; the flying copilot called the Captain and said the wall was very hot and recommended we land. The Captain hung up the phone; said he had the aircraft; and told me to advise ATC that we needed an immediate divert. I made a call requesting the diversion for a fire in the back of the aircraft and advised [ATC]. I also requested firefighting and rescue crews be there for arrival. Immediately; ATC gave us clearance to ZZZ via an initial heading (270?) and an initial descent (15;000) with the local altimeter setting. Shortly after passing FL180; the flying copilot came to the cockpit. I let him in and he took his seat.The Captain and flying copilot took over the radios and flying duties while I coordinated with the Flight Attendant and made a PA to the passengers about the diversion. The Captain continued to fly as the flying First Officer briefed an approach and landing which he would fly for the ILS. Once the brief was complete; they completed the approach descent checklist. In my coordination with the Flight Attendants; I told them it would be 10-15 minutes before landing; with fire and rescue crews standing by. While still descending; the Captain directed me to give a quick call to Dispatch to advise them of our divert and to ask them to coordinate with operations. After that was completed; two more calls came from the Flight Attendants in the back saying the oven wall was still very hot and there was some lingering smoke. I told the Captain about the hot wall and he asked for a high speed descent to expedite the arrival. ATC granted that request. ATC gave us continuing descents to approach altitude and vectors for an ILS. Captain had me look up and provide him with the runway length as we did not have time to get landing performance data via ACARS. While being vectored; I next pulled up the reference guide for diversions to make sure we had all the bases covered; which we did. Next; at approximately 25 miles out; I told the Flight Attendants we would be on the ground in 8 minutes. Intercepting final I made a PA to the Flight Attendants we would be landing in 3 minutes. This call and PA were provided to the Flight Attendants because they had carts; trays; meals; drinks; etc. to pick up and I wanted them to be in their seats prior to landing.The approach and landing were uneventful. On rollout; the passengers were told to remain seated. We stopped on the runway; set the brakes; and shut the engines down. The Flight Attendants called and said there was no smoke or fire; but the wall was still hot. With that information; we ran the [appropriate] checklist one more time. After that; the after landing flows were completed along with the parking checklist. Additionally; the reference guide diversion recovery checklist was reviewed. Fire crews came on board and determined the fire was out and was contained in the oven; which was still hot. Lastly; maintenance came on the aircraft and removed the oven before we were towed to the gate.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Turned on APU bleed and cooled AC but FA (Flight Attendant) still complained about smell. Called Maintenance and they researched the smell but could not locate. They called their supervisor who also did not find the cause. They said it was just stale E&E (Electrical and Environmental) air circulating. Supervisors supervisor showed up with two other Maintenance personnel and did another inspection. They said that they could smell a faint smell but could not pinpoint or locate it and signed off logbook. FA called their supervisors to aircraft in which they said that they could smell the smell. They then took 3 of the 4 [Flight Attendants] off the trip to hospital. Then the head of Maintenance showed up and said he smelled the smell. He promptly called and had the AC removed from line and moved to hanger and also lined up a replacement aircraft. He stated that we were not going to fly that AC with a smell. My write up in logbook was about a strong odor aboard which was signed off OK by Maintenance. While we were retrieving our bags another Maintenance person a showed up and wanted me to write in the logbook refused aircraft.

900,900,900,900,9544,Single engine taxi due to lengthy taxi delays created by passing thunderstorm. Delays for arrival and departure due to thundershowers that just passed overhead. Holding short of Runway 22 on Foxtrot; received clearance to cross 22 on F join Taxiway E; expedite crossing traffic on 1.5 mile final. Power on engine one was brought up and the nose of the aircraft started forward and then started to skip/skid towards the right at an aggressive pace. Captain retarded the thrust added full left tiller and I advised Ground we had to stop. Aircraft was brought under control and stopped across the runway hold line. Ground was advised. Although nothing we did violated FAA/AIM regulations; an aircraft on approach was sent around and Ground was upset with us. The reason for the skidding is suspected to be standing water on a black top non grooved pavement with rubber from aircraft tires since this is a runway turn off. Use of less thrust single engine taxi in this case would of prevented this; but the expedite issuance by ATC for the landing aircraft created a 'need' to power up and get across the runway mind process.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
901,901,901,901,2393,I was cleared to taxi to Runway 28L via 'Z and Z1'. Using the Jeppesen taxi chart I verified the taxi route and taxied to the runway. Enroute; I noticed what appeared to be an 'IFR' hold short line. Since IFR operations were not in effect I taxied past the line. I was immediately instructed by ground control to stop; and complied.Just prior to takeoff clearance I was given a phone number and directed to call back to the tower after I landed. Upon landing I contacted the tower and was directed to provide my name; address; phone number and certificate number. When I asked if a violation was coming I was told that I 'would probably get a warning letter because this happens all the time'. I suggested that if 'this happens all the time' it is not just a pilot issue but also an airport issue; pilots don't intentionally violate rules. There should be a sign near the hold short line to make it obvious; so pilots don't miss it. The Jeppesen taxi chart does not show a hold short line for taxiway Z1; but does show one for taxiway A1; on the other side of the runway. The hold short line for a1 is a hotspot with an explanation.

903,903,903,903,3632,On final approach; as I started to slow to ref speed on glide path and only a few hundred feet from the approach end I noticed a vehicle on the end taxiway approaching the runway but not encroaching. At this point I knew there would be no conflict even if the vehicle encroached on the runway. I assumed it was a maintenance vehicle of some source. Just as the end of the runway was coming up and before my vision was blocked to the right by the right nacelle I saw the vehicle moving. I put a little back pressure on the yoke even though I knew I had plenty of room if the vehicle did encroach. At no time did I think there was a clearance issue. Just as I crossed the end of the runway a bright blue parachute billowed up in front of the right wing. I banked the airplane hard to the left and avoided a collision. After righting the airplane I made an uneventful landing on the runway. The powered parachute did not taxi back in but instead took off and flew locally for 15-20 minutes. I confronted the pilot when he taxied in. He said he heard our radio call but did not see us.

904,904,904,904,3404,I started my time on position by working Ground/Tower CIC for 0+28 minutes. I was then relieved on Ground so that training may be accomplished on Ground. After the 2 minute overlap; I moved over to Local and remained on Tower CIC for the next 01+09. We were landing Runway 36. Time on position was pretty busy and complex. Numerous arrivals and departures mixed with sightseeing helicopters. There was a lot of frequency congestion during my time on position due to the sightseeing helicopters requesting the routes and an aircraft requesting to cross the approach end of Runway 36 on many occasions.Approximately 40 minutes into my time on Local; Aircraft X checked in 10 miles northwest of the airport on the visual approach Runway 36. At the time; Aircraft Y was taxiing to Runway 36 on the ground frequency. A few minutes later; Aircraft Y called me ready for takeoff. I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff Runway 36 and to fly runway heading. A minute later; I heard the ground trainee mention that this was not going to work. I looked up and realized that Aircraft X was approximately 1 mile final at 400 feet. Aircraft Y was past the hold short line turning the corner onto the runway. I then told Aircraft X to go around and Aircraft Y to hold his position for a minute. Once they were no longer a factor for each other; I instructed Aircraft X to enter the downwind and re-cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff. Aircraft X was climbing on the go around prior to reaching the runway threshold.At the time of the event; training was in progress on Ground Control. The Instructor and CPC-IT were engaged in a conversation that was work/personal related; but not training related. It did create some distraction.I have suggested many times that during busy summer traffic; sightseeing helicopters should have their own frequency and a separate Local Controller. Not sure if this is a good solution to fix the problem of confusion that can be created by frequency congestion; but the recommendation is not very welcome when brought up. I have not heard anybody else make any recommendations on how to make the situation better.At the time of this go around; there were a few helicopters making their runs. They all operate at or below 1;200. When there is a lot of congestion; the D-BRITE is very cluttered around MYR which makes it hard to see when aircraft are flying through this area. Aircraft X entered the downwind from the northwest and his tag was lost in all the clutter. That is the only reasoning I can come up with in forgetting that he was there.

Received weights; but they disagreed with reconciliation card from the Gate Agent. First Officer sent message of passenger count from card. While waiting on response; and as I was taxiing; I was instructed by Tower to expedite through the 4L approach as traffic was on 3 mile final. Rounding the bend on B; we had the traffic in sight. The east side of B had little room to clear the 4L approach area and signage was poor. I saw the M sign for the right turn; but missed the M sign for the left turn toward Runway 9 as it was greater than 90 degrees behind to the left and I was splitting my attention with the traffic on final.

I believe this to be a systemic issue and that a 7110.65 change be initiated to close the loop.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
910,910,910,910,4560,I had finished run-up and taxied to the holding line on the taxiway. I was first in line for takeoff. When I got to the holding line; I canted the aircraft towards final; and did a quick scan of the downwind.I saw an aircraft on downwind and heard him announce he was extending his downwind to let the traffic bunched up on the taxiway to depart.I then asked my passenger to read the takeoff tasks listed on the console as I did not want to forget to adjust the mixture to full rich (after leaning for taxi) or to turn on the electric fuel pump.He did; and I checked them as he read them off. (The reason I had my passenger read those tasks was because I had read in [a] magazine it's a good idea to give your passenger(s) something to do so they feel involved in the flight.) After getting those checks done; I checked for traffic on the downwind and traffic on final. I saw no traffic on either; and had heard no announcement of aircraft turning base or final; so I began to depart.As I turned on the runway; I heard a plane announce he was on final and was landing over top of me.I immediately pulled the throttle; applied full brakes and my aircraft quickly came to a stop within the threshold markings.The aircraft on final flew well over me (at about 175-200 AGL); landed about halfway down the runway and executed a touch and go. Which is why I say there was no evasive action taken.I made three mistakes in this incident; two of which are something others might want to be aware of when carrying a passenger in the right seat.1.) Contributing factors: I had the passenger read the takeoff task list on the console when we were at the hold line. That was the wrong time to do so. And I believe this is why I did not hear the plane landing make his announcements.Preventing a recurrence:When at the hold line; I'll concentrate on listening to and looking for other aircraft in the pattern. I will either read the tasks myself; or have the passenger read them; before leaving the run-up area.2.) Contributing factor:When looking for traffic on final; I did not ask my passenger to move his head so I could get a clear view. I believe the passenger blocked my seeing the plane on final.Preventing a recurrence:I will ask my passengers to move their heads so I have a clear view of final; and also use the passengers as a second set of eyes and ask them to look and see if they see any aircraft on final.3.) Contributing factor:Hearing the aircraft on downwind announce he was extending his downwind to let traffic depart and assuming he was number one to land.Preventing a recurrence:I'll never again assume that the aircraft I see and hear is the only one in the pattern. I'll make sure to check with both my ears and eyes to verify where traffic is.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
911,911,911,911,2009,I embarked on what was meant to be a local flight beginning and terminating at [home airport]. I had a single passenger with me in the right seat. I climbed above a scattered to broken layer of clouds to an altitude of 11500 feet heading northeast to prevent straying into [other Class B or Class C airspace]. I only did a minimal check of the weather. I checked METAR and TAF. After taking some pictures of the sunset; I tuned the VOR and took up a heading of 140 to the station. I am still not totally sure what happened but after flying that heading for more than 10 miles and watching the 'to' flag change from 'to' to what looked like 'from'; I began a descent through a hole in the clouds. I quickly realized that I was not over ZZZ as I should have been but over a mountain slope. Climbing back above the clouds which were growing in height and filling in; I contacted ATC who had me squawk and gave me a vector back toward ZZZ. I was unable to comply with vectors numerous times because I could not out climb the clouds. Finally after asking my remaining fuel (2.5 hours) they vectored me east. When I alerted ATC Center that I had an airport beacon in sight; they identified it as being ZZZ1 Airport. They gave me the current numbers for the airport and told me if I was able to keep the beacon in sight I continue and land. As it turned out; the NOTAM that should have been in place showing that the airport was closed due to unplowed snow on the runway had expired and was not renewed. I ended up landing on a runway that had 10 inches of heavy snow on it and caused the aircraft to partially depart from the runway. No damage to the aircraft occurred and there were no injuries. NTSB cleared me to move the aircraft once the field was plowed if my A&P inspection deemed it to be airworthy which I did the following day without further incident.Contributing Factors: Inadequate check of the weather for a high altitude flight into high winds aloft which made climbing penetration difficult while returning to ZZZ. Did not have my hand held GPS in the airplane so when I failed to be able to successfully navigate using my NAV radio; I had no backup. Airport failed to issue NOTAM or mark the runway closed. Lights were on at time of landing.My personal minimums had been pretty high. I have lowered my minimums after this experience and if flying at high altitude over the top of cloud layer; I will have a flight plan with alternates to make sure this doesn't happen again. I plan on putting a second source of navigation in my aircraft as well IFR GPS hopefully this year.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
912,912,912,912,5244,I was the First Officer (FO) on [the] flight. We landed on 31 from the expressway visual and made the T turnoff. Tower had said make the left turn off at T. I switched the radio to ground and the captain took the ground frequency while I called ramp to get clearance into the gate. After I had come back to ground frequency the captain had not gotten a word in yet as the frequency was congested and there was a lot of traffic. We were still on T at an angle to B. I checked in with ground finally and stated we were off (runway 31) and joining B. Ground said go straight ahead on bravo and hold short of G. There was an Airbus making the turn from A to G. We were told to give way to Airbus and then hold short of F.Ground changed their mind and said Airbus gives way to you; proceed on B and hold short of F. Then ground asked if we were cleared in to the gate. I stated after 2 outbound aircraft out of the alley we were cleared into the gate. They said okay go F and A and hold short of your alley until you can get in. We taxied from B and took a left on F and a second left on A and held short of the alley while a company aircraft exited the alley. After they were clear we turned right into the alley and into the gate. We followed all of these instructions as stated.Upon reaching the gate; the captain received a phone call from the tower stating we did not hold short of the taxiways we were told to on the way in. We in fact held short of G when asked and also held short of F and the ramp as we were told or until we were told otherwise. The controller also said on the phone; according to the captain; that we were originally told to turn left onto B after exiting the runway. If the case; I did not hear nor read back the instruction to turn left onto bravo.I believe we followed the instructions as they were issued. Some factors though that may have contributed to any deviation that occurred according to the controllers could've been misinterpretation of the taxi instructions on our part or ATC forgetting what instructions they gave us. It was the last leg of days of work for me so fatigue was starting to set in. I could have missed an instruction issued by ground and as a result did not read back the correct instructions and was also not corrected by the controller.It is important to listen to all instructions closely as they are given and confirm them if any doubt exists. There were a number of distractions including talking to ground/tower; calling the ramp to find out the status of the gate; completing the after landing flows/checklist; and most importantly keeping a heads up awareness outside the aircraft especially in a designated Hotspot.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
913,913,913,913,2493,On date of event; I was working and training on Ground Control with my trainer. There was a NOTAM published and broadcasted on the ATIS that the larger runway; RWY 35L was closed; due to maintenance. All aircraft had to use RWY 35R (unless exceeded weight of 12;500 lbs; where then coordination would take place to use Rwy 35L temporarily). Because of the shorter runway being the ONLY runway in use; as well as being a beautiful; sunny VFR day; traffic levels and complexity were high. For all aircraft to get to the active runway; they must first cross the active runway; but at the departure end; then continue taxi to the active. In the general phraseology used to each aircraft; due to today's closed runway condition; 'hold short of Runway 35R' and runway assignment of 'Runway 35R' were in same statement. An aircraft called for VFR flight to NW with having the current ATIS information. I responded; 'Runway 35R; taxi via Echo; Foxtrot. Hold Short of Runway 35R.' The pilot read back the taxi and hold short instructions correctly. I had many other aircraft on frequency for clearance and taxi requests. I gave a clearance to an aircraft when my trainer and I noticed the aircraft taxi across the active Runway 35R while on Taxiway Echo; then continue on to Foxtrot; as instructed. We immediately made sure that there were no aircraft on final or departing on the active and communicated with the Local controller about what happened. We did not stop the aircraft because his taxi speed was fast and no aircraft were on the active runway at the moment. On his route of taxi he would first need to cross the active runway then be able to proceed onto Taxiway Foxtrot for remaining taxiing to the approach end for departure. Once at the approach end; and before I transferred him to Tower frequency; I notified the pilot of a possible pilot deviation and to contact the tower with the phone number I provided. He later called the tower and spoke the the FLM (Front Line Manager) on duty once landed at his destination. Because of the situation with Runway 35L closed; it may have been confusing to the pilots; instructing them to hold short of their runway assignment. They may have thought that once done taxing via the taxi-way routes; THEN hold short of the active runway at the approach end; where they are to depart from. Most pilots are used to crossing runways with intersections associated with it. Here; at DWH; our airfield configuration is different; and we do not need to say 'Hold short of Runway 35R at ECHO'. After the event; I incorporated that phraseology into my clearances and had no further conflicts; incidents; events; or confusion from the pilots.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

918,918,918,918,3770,While departing MCC on an IFR clearance; we waited for a VFR King Air to land and clear the runway. Once he announced he was clear we announced on CTAF we were departing Runway 16; straight out. Observing our arrival and departure corridors to be clear of traffic; I positioned the aircraft on the centerline at the end of the runway; held brakes and began advancing power. At that moment I heard 'McClellan Traffic; RV departing 16 at Kilo.' I observed a small Van's kitbuilt airplane entering the runway downfield at Kilo intersection. I reduced power to idle and told him on the radio we were departing runway 16 and asked if he saw us. No reply. I began taxiing clear of the runway; calling him two more times to ask if he saw or heard us. No reply. Once he was airborne; I called him again. This time he responded. I told him he took off in front of us; and caused a runway incursion. He sounded unapologetic; explaining that he never saw us or heard us. That was the end of our conversation. Once he was clear; we resumed our takeoff.McClellan has a slight rise between the runway ends. I suspect his aircraft; being very small and low to the ground; was far enough away from us (approximately 7;000' down the runway) so as to have a difficult time seeing us - but we could see him. Furthermore; we were on Comm1 using our bottom antenna. I suspect his antenna may also have been bottom mounted; thus he may not have heard us until he was airborne. By Runway Incursion categories; I rate this as a Cat C: 'an incident characterized by ample time and or distance to avoid a collision.'Due to McClellan's long runway; intersection takeoffs are not uncommon; particularly from light GA aircraft using the self-service fuel island on the SW side of the field. However; normal and heavy operators almost always use full runway length. I believe the pilot of [the Van's] did not sufficiently clear the runway prior to taking off. We had all of our landing/recognition lights on and made a radio call prior to taxiing onto the runway - we should have been very visible to him. Once it was obvious to me he either could not see/hear us or was choosing to ignore us; I aborted my takeoff and removed us from the runway as quickly as possible.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

921,921,921,921,9342,I was training on Local Control; during a busy VFR Friday afternoon. I started falling behind and the On the Job Training Instructor took over the frequency. I continued to assist by managing the strip-board and making rolling calls. Aircraft Y was landing RWY 11; with Aircraft X landing shortly thereafter on RWY 16. Aircraft Y types are normally very slow; with short landing distances; usually able to exit TWY F (1;200 feet); and at most to reach taxi speed and hold short of RWY 16 (2;500 feet). With this preceding experience; it was anticipated that Aircraft Y would be clear of RWY 11 or given taxi-speed hold instructions prior to Aircraft X occupying RWY 16. While Aircraft Y's approach and touchdown appeared normal; it continued down the runway at a higher than expected speed. Aircraft Y advised it was unable to make TWY L (2;500 feet; just prior to the RWY 16 hold line). Aircraft X was able to slow and exit before the RWY intersection. Aircraft Y was able to exit TWY H; inside the RWY intersection.Always have a plan in the event aircraft to not perform the way you expect them to; which still ensures separation.

927,927,927,927,2638,We landed uneventfully; but late; at LGA at night; with rain and two miles visibility. Once the Captain started taxiing; I confirmed that the gate was open and then told Ground. They asked if the alley was open; because 'it had been an issue lately;' so I asked Ramp. Ramp said that (other carrier) was in the alleyway and we could taxi in when (other carrier) taxied out. We taxied on Bravo; held short of Juliet (per Ground's instructions) and waited. It was night; it was raining but we could see a light blue (other carrier) sitting at the top of the alley after having just been pushed back. It is well documented that LGA does not have signs; only pavement markings to delineate Taxilane 8 versus 9.We had discussed in the preflight briefing prior to landing; the location of Taxilane 9; since I was on a flight months ago; where we went past that. We knew it was just past Taxiway Lima. (Other carrier) started to taxi out; we informed Ground; and he cleared us onto Alpha to the Ramp. Multiple aircraft behind us were also cleared to follow us into the ramp. I made a radio call to Ramp telling him we were inbound and he told us that (other carrier) was still in the alley. As we got closer; we saw a little (other carrier) roughly at position 9D. He had a dark paint scheme; was at the base of the alley and we could only see him once we had taxied closer. There were two (other carrier) aircraft in the alley; we were simply told to 'taxi in after (other carrier) taxied out.'At that point we stopped; asked Ground what he wanted us to do; and he informed us that we 'had to get off Alpha because we were blocking his aircraft flow to the runway.' The Captain exited on Taxilane 8; the (other carrier) pulled up towards 9A and he transitioned behind the (other carrier) to Taxilane 9. We taxied uneventfully to Gate. I was merely trying to tell the Ramp Controller that his instructions were misinterpreted because we were not told the type of aircraft and that there were actually two (other carrier) in the alley. I couldn't get a word in because the Ramp Controller merely wanted to argue about how he was the clearance authority for the ramp; etc. He was upset that we didn't see the second (other carrier) aircraft and that the Captain used common sense to transition behind (other carrier) to Taxilane 9; which was where we were expected to enter anyway.Inform the Ramp Controllers that at night; in adverse weather and reduced visibility; with taxilane markings on the concrete (not signs) that are not visible to Aircrew; that it is imperative to be specific with his triggers. Aircrew are expected to talk to two Controlling Agencies and work out these problems; but the two Controlling Agencies never talk to one another; so Pilots are the go-betweens. The Ramp Controller was only concerned with his designated authority for taxi instructions in the ramp/alleyway; rather than realizing why we were not able to read his mind and had to get off of Alpha because we were already committed; once on Taxiway A. I'm guessing; the Ramp Controllers probably could use additional training and/or procedures; since Ground already informed us that the ramp 'had been an issue lately'.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

The Captain taxied out and crossed what he thought was the approach holding line for 8R not realizing that doing so took him onto the extended threshold of 8R. After I finished the checklist and flows I noticed we were on a threshold and questioned him. He said no this is the approach area and the runway starts ahead. At exactly that time the Tower called and advised we had taxied past the hold short area but that it was no problem and that we were cleared for takeoff. Nothing further was said by the controller about the occurrence. The flight continued with no other issues.We were both tired from early wake up calls on the last leg of day four. This was a VERY short taxi from gate to runway and I was preoccupied running all the needed flows and checklists to get plane ready for takeoff. 90 percent of that time my head was down or occupied on flows. It is also a VERY confusing area transitioning from the ramp to the runway.

936,936,936,936,3196,I had just landed at APA on Runway 35L. I rolled to about the second or third exit on the right and turned off facing east. I then proceeded east to the Bravo Taxiway to go north. At some point prior I was given instructions to do what I was doing and to hold short of Runway 35R. I read back the instructions to the Tower Controller and said I would in fact hold short of Runway 35R since my plan was to eventually cross Runway 35R and go to FBO on the east/northeast side of the field. After I proceeded north on the Bravo Taxiway; I turned right to go east and crossed over what later (5 seconds or so it seems) appeared to be the holding position marking that was right after the turn-off and not near Runway 35L like I expected it to be. I was looking so far ahead; to make certain I would see the holding position marking that I missed the one I was supposed to stop at. It seemed to have been situated immediately after the turnoff from Taxiway Bravo; rather than closer to the runway ahead of me (Runway 35R). For over 25 years I have been flying into APA and to other Class B; C and D airports and this situation really took me by surprise. I have never seen the hold line so close to the taxiway I was just leaving. It came as quite a surprise; since the lines have always been closer to the runway I am/was approaching; not behind me on the taxiway I am/was leaving. It seems as if perhaps the lines have been moved or repainted. I would NEVER have crossed the runway ahead of me (Runway 35R) since I have always been cautious not to do so at APA or anywhere else. I am certain that I have done the same procedure at least fifty times over the years on the same taxiway and runway at the same airport (APA). At my last FIRC (Flight Instructor Refresher Clinic); back in 2009 we actually spent a couple of hours on LAHSO (land and hold short operations) and were given a DVD and flashcards to use with our students.

I gave the crossing at Lima; and with a restriction for traffic on the runway; Bravo twice.  I had planned to use Line Up and Wait (LUAW) for Aircraft X; but because of the tower staffing being marginal; Controller In Charge (CIC) was combined with Clearance Delivery (CD); and LUAW was not authorized. I remembered that; so I didn't line Aircraft X up. When I observed the landing aircraft clear the runway; I cleared Aircraft X for takeoff; forgetting about the crossing. When Aircraft X rounded the corner; the first crossing was complete. The ground controller alerted me that they were still crossing one more; and was able to stop the second aircraft Y in the flight before they crossed the hold bars. I cancelled Aircraft X's takeoff clearance; they exited them from F1 and the second Aircraft Y crossed without incident.I need to be more focused coming into the position.

After reviewing the tapes Aircraft X did leave out the 'runway 16' on the hold short read back. A few seconds after aircraft X says 'we are lining up and waiting'.

I observed Aircraft Y; 1/2 mile final landing on Runway XR and a small GA aircraft on Taxiway [5] turning South on Taxiway [3]. I didn't observe any other targets or obstructions on the runway surface area. At that time Aircraft Y was already flaring out on the runway.

I then informed the Controller if the safety logic says to send someone around on a runway which the aircraft was landing it was mandatory to comply.

944,944,944,944,3313,I was the First Officer and pilot monitoring for the flight. Arriving at CYYZ we landed on Runway 24L and Tower told us to exit on [Taxiway] D4 and hold short of [Runway] 24R. Taxiway D4 is a high speed exit on the right side of the runway and while we were on the taxiway we noted an aircraft taking off and immediately stopped. At the same time Tower told us to; 'Stop; stop; stop.' We were still on Taxiway D4 and not on the actual runway surface of 24R. It was immediately evident that they suspected we crossed the hold short line for 24R and quickly had us cross the runway after the traffic we noted had departed. As I briefed before; at no time did our aircraft go onto the actual runway of 24R and the departing traffic was insight during this whole occurrence. Recalling the event; because it was dark and the lighting was dim with a combination of poor signage; it was not clear that we had exceeded any hold short line. If by chance we had exceed the line; at no point was our aircraft on the surface of 24R when both my Captain and I had the departing traffic insight. I believe that the cause of the problem was poor signage and lighting at CYYZ. I believe the signs there are not lit from within so that the whole sign lights up like in the U.S. Instead the signs have colored bulbs displaying only the numbers/letters so it is different and not as visible as the whole sign with colors; etc. being lit up. I would recommend [that] the in-surface lighting on the high speed taxiway be enhanced and also the signage [should] be better lit than it is to increase safety for pilots transitioning from a high speed taxiway to the critical hold short area.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

As the First Officer on the flight; I turned my head to the right to see if we were clear right.  I was looking to the right and back at the wingtip to make sure we had proper clearance for the right hand turn.

On Taxiway E; Ground Control instructed to turn left on to Taxiway B to Taxiway F1 and join Taxiway A to the gate and go in front of another carrier's aircraft that was on Taxiway A. The Captain and I discussed the taxi clearance and agreed on the instructions. I had the 10-9 page displayed on the EFB and assisted the Captain during taxi operations. I made sure we were well clear of the other aircraft and transitioned onto Taxiway A from Taxiway B and Taxiway F1. Taxiway F1 was difficult to identify with ground markings/signage. We remained well clear of the other carrier and cut slightly from Taxiway B to F1 and then joined Taxiway A.  Ground markings/paintings/signage is very poor and confusing in this area.

948,948,948,948,1710,I put Aircraft Y into position to hold on Runway 34R while I crossed aircraft downfield. I crossed the two aircraft that were holding short of that runway. I then went to Aircraft X who was holding short of Runway 34C at Taxiway J and had him cross 34C and hold short of 34R. Once the first two aircraft were across Runway 34R I scanned the runway and cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff. As he was starting his roll I noticed Aircraft X moving at a good speed and crossing the hold short lines for Runway 34R. As soon as a saw this I told him to stop and he immediately slammed on his breaks. I then went to Aircraft Y and cancelled his takeoff clearance. Aircraft X was given the brasher warning by ground control and when he called the tower he said that the sun was in their eyes and they were unable to see the hold lines.I feel that the position of Taxiway J/H as it crosses 34R is an issue. This intersection was just redone and the new layout is a hazard. When we use this taxiway for staging; which is only in a north flow; the aircraft holding there are facing to the northeast; away from traffic at the approach end of Runway 34R.

949,949,949,949,5490,After a normal preflight and startup procedure; I taxied up to and held short of the movement line at the C9 cargo ramp at DFW International Airport. Visibility was low due to fog surrounding the airport. My First Officer (English is not his first language) called the west ground control on 121.85; informing the controller that we were at C9 ready to taxi with the current ATIS. We had a transponder set correctly; and had it set to ALT. The controller replied: '[Flight ABCD]; DFW Ground; taxi via Charlie; hold short of runway 18R at Yankee. You can expect 17...correction; 17R for departure.' The First Officer read back the instructions to which ATC replied again 'And; just want to confirm; hold short of 18R at Yankee.' This was read back once again by the First Officer.At this time; we slowly taxied forward onto taxiway Charlie from C9; and made a left turn to head down Charlie towards taxiway Yankee. As soon as we were centered on taxiway Charlie headed Northbound; I saw in front of us a very faint pair of white lights through the fog; in the middle of the taxiway. A few seconds later a large jet appeared suddenly out of the fog. Both myself and [the air carrier] appeared to be taxiing very slowly due to the low visibility; and we both quickly came to a stop a few hundred feet away. Sometime between seeing the [other aircraft]; and us both coming to a stop; ATC came on stating '[Flight ABCD] turn right on Charlie; Right on Charlie!' followed shortly by '[Flight ABCD]; do you see the little aircraft ahead of you? Stop; stop stop!' By this point; we had both come to a complete stop; but ATC could not see that from the tower. After a brief pause; ATC came back on saying '[Flight ABCD]; turn right.' At this time I personally took the radios; and read back the instruction. Both aircraft had stopped with enough room that allowed me to safely make a U-turn on taxiway Charlie to head south. ATC then instructed '[Flight ABCD]; hold short of 18R at Whiskey Lima' The instruction was read back; and the taxi and flight continued without further incident.I believe it is possible; that the ground controller thought we were at the north end of the field; where a majority of [our] operations occur. It is possible that due to a language barrier between the First Officer and the Controller; that he misunderstood or misheard the initial position call.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

953,953,953,953,8273,During preflight we discovered that the ATC tower would not be opening until XA:00. We pushed back; and made a radio call over CTAF of our planned taxi route of taxiway A; then E to runway 10. As we turned onto E I completed the taxi check and looked up to see some flashing lights on the taxiway as we approached E1. The captain slowed down his taxi pace to read the sign corresponding to the lights. We both mentioned that neither of us had seen flashing lights on a taxiway like that before. I don't remember the exact verbiage of the sign; but it stated something about the ILS critical area and a time range at the bottom. My initial thought was that the lights and sign meant that the ILS critical area is extended to this point when the tower is closed. At this point the captain had stopped the plane short of the lights and the captain and I both figured that it is VMC so the ILS critical area wasn't a factor. Even on IMC days we are rarely instructed to hold short of ILS critical areas. Unfortunately neither of us thought to review the Jepp 10-9 page and we continued to taxi down E to runway 10. As we crossed the lights I even noted that the standard ILS critical area markings were not even painted on the taxiway. We then communicated with Jacksonville center; made a call to CTAF and took off on runway 10. About 10-15 minutes into the flight the captain reviewed the SAV 10-9 and saw the note that read 'Twy E west of E1 closed when tower closed due to ILS critical area.' It was at this point we realized we had taxied on a closed taxiway. We unintentionally taxied onto a closed taxiway and although it didn't threaten the safety of the flight it was an error on our part. The error we made was to not investigate the reasoning for the unusual lights further by reviewing the SAV 10-9 page more closely.In the future I can take the time to investigate unusual taxiway markings further by studying the 10-9 more closely and by not just going with my preconceived notion of what the lights meant. The note on the 10-9 page does not really stick out when glancing over the 10-9 page because it is at a different part of the page from other notes and is not bolded. It would be helpful to add a note to the XJT -7 page regarding the closure of the taxiway when the tower is closed.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
954,954,954,954,4110,I was working all positions combined. Aircraft X called ready for departure on Runway XX.  I knew that prior to the clearance that a maintenance aircraft had previously been taxiing on it but I assumed that he was long gone as plenty of time had passed.  After clearing the aircraft for departure; I saw that the taxiing aircraft had stopped and was still on the runway and it would seem Aircraft X noticed it also as we stepped on each other.  Departure roll never occurred.   I canceled his takeoff clearance and re-cleared him once the taxiing aircraft was off the runway.  In my opinion; there were several causes for this mistake:1.  First and foremost; I was distracted by other duties and my scan failed.  I also was the victim of my own expectation bias as plenty of time had passed that most of the other maintenance aircraft would have been off the runway at the time.2.  The ramp construction has gone on for an incredible length of time and the only way that maintenance aircraft have to get from one area to the next is on the runway. Taxiing on the runway is a standard operation and is a safety issue in and of itself.3.  I was distracted by updating the binders in the Tower Cab and other FLM duties.4. The FLMs are required to be in the Cab for 5 hours a shift.  Due to the social distancing requirements associated with COVID-19; the only way to accomplish all duties and meet all requirements is for the FLMs to work 5 hours a shift while the staffing only works 3.I don't know if there's anything that can be done on a facility level but I can speak for myself.  No amount of paperwork nor organizational rules will ever pre-empt providing a safe environment for aircraft. I may have lost sight of that and I know now that there's nothing that cannot wait to be done.

956,956,956,956,4767,While taxiing for departure at MCO from a southwest location on the field to a departure from Runway 17R ([Runway] 18L closed for construction and [Runway] 18L closed for aircraft issue); Ground Controller gave me taxi instructions from the FBO to Alpha to Bravo 2 cross [Runway] 18R and hold short of [Runway] 18L. After arriving and holding short of [Runway] 18L he issued further instructions to cross [Runway] 18L turn right on Charlie then left on Juliette to Juliette 4 and hold short of Juliette 4. Ground then gave a corporate jet following me the same instructions except for them to hold at Juliette 2. I asked Ground to clarify my hold at Juliette 4 and he confirmed. I continued taxi when he said for me to hold and let the corporate jet pass me since he had a slot time into his destination; which I did. He said after the corporate jet passed to continue on to [Runway] 17R and monitor Tower on 118.45. I asked the Ground Controller if he still needed the hold at Juliette 4 which he said I was already past Juliette 4 and just follow the corporate jet.Then I realized that the Juliette 4 taxiway sign was positioned facing to the north and it was necessary to face south to see it. I was taxing east on Juliette and failed to see the sign. I had seen the Juliette 3 sign and was prepared to stop; but obviously got past J4 and stopped before I got to J5 when I observed the sign. There were no other aircraft in the vicinity other than the corporate jet; which passed me on the Airside 2 ramp and no issues resulted to my knowledge. I have been flying out of MCO for many years and this was a highly irregular taxi due to the closure of both [runways] 18R and 18L; so I was diligently paying attention to the taxi instructions since I was operating in the air carrier environment. I am amiss how I could have possibly gotten by J4 without seeing it. In reviewing the airport diagram for MCO it appears J3 and J4 share the same taxiway that is undivided by a median of grass so maybe one is for inbound and the other for outbound to the north side of Airside 2 air carrier ramp. If that is the case the sign was positioned on the east side of the taxiway thus past it before it is visible. I know it is my responsibility to adhere to all instructions and I obviously missed this one. In the future I will stop taxi and query the controller before potentially making a similar mistake. I don't think any issues resulted; but nonetheless I don't like making mistakes especially when I am so diligently paying attention and watching intently for my hold short point.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
957,957,957,957,8138,After landing; Tower issued instructions; '[Taxi via] B; U; Contact Ground.' As the Captain was taxiing off the runway I observed the taxiway sign that appeared to be on the taxiway we were on. The sign had a black 'U' between two directional signs; one of which was a 'B'. I quickly looked at the airport diagram and saw that one of the two parallel taxiways was 'A' so I assumed the other was 'B'. When the Captain didn't take the hard left turn I didn't say anything because I thought Taxiway B was the outboard taxiway. I switched to Ground and made contact. Ground then informed us that we missed the left turn to Taxiway U. He then reissued instructions to get us back to Taxiway U. After getting back on the correct taxiway; I looked closer at the airport diagram; 'B' is the taxiway coming off the runway with 'U' and 'A' being the parallel taxiways. The parallel taxiways next to the runways are 'U' and 'A'. Taxiway B is the taxiway used to exit Runway 2. Additionally; Taxiway B is a very short high speed taxiway. By the time the aircraft is clear of the runway; you are almost half way through Taxiway U; and the signs you can see from that point are confusing. Include the taxi as part of the brief.

959,959,959,959,7841,Ramp control was not open so PHL ground control gave us push back clearance; taxi clearance and clearance onto the runway 27L from the ground control frequency.  PHL ground asked if we were ready for takeoff as we neared runway 27L. We said we would be a few minutes. When we were ready I asked the Fist Officer (FO) to let tower know. The FO said he was waiting for the frequency to clear. I said I heard nothing on the frequency. The FO adjusted his communication panel and called saying we were ready for departure.  Later I discovered he had been hearing ramp on the #2 radio as we both listened to ATC on the #1 radio. ATC should not give a tower frequency instruction on the ground frequency. If ATC gives a tower instruction from ground frequency they should also broadcast on both tower and ground to complete the takeoff instructions.  We were given a clearance to line-up and wait on runway 27L. After the FO and I verbally stated the runway was clear both directions we taxied onto runway 27L and held with the brakes on.  After a short time holding on the runway we received a call from ground control to switch to the tower frequency. By the time I looked down the FO had already switched to tower frequency. When we switched we could hear the tower giving an aircraft cleared to land on runway 27L go-around instructions.  The FO should have confirmed the tower frequency was being used before entering the runway.The FO is new the aircraft and was a little task-loaded to get through the checklists as we were number 1 for takeoff (no delays waiting for other aircraft to give more time). I did not realize we were not on tower frequency when were cleared onto the runway as I was taxing and actively looking for traffic.  ATC should not have cleared us onto the runway using the ground control frequency.Switching from #2 to #1 radio going from ramp to ATC is a new policy change. I believe this contributed to creating the error that occurred as the FO had called ramp a few times before switching to ground for a push back clearance and was still listening to the ramp frequency assuming it was ATC when we let ATC know we were ready for takeoff.  I should have confirmed the tower frequency was being used before entering the runway.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

He told me I could go straight in to Runway 34. We were too close to BTF after the tower handoff; but I got Runway 34 in sight and descended to land.We did not realized that 16 was active; and when I landed; there was a Piper Archer who exited runway 16 to get out of my way.  I should have switched to Advisory and circled over the airport traffic pattern and listened to advisory and would have realized I was planning to land the wrong runway.  Part of the problem was the wind was light and variable and either runway could have been active; and I also put too much faith in my passenger to know what was going on; even though neither of us realized the problem until we landed. Also; during this flight; my right seat passenger was trying to become more familiar with [the aircraft] because he was interested in purchasing one; and this distracted me from my usual procedure to set up a visual approach far ahead and have everything planned and understood in advance.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
964,964,964,964,79,We were number one for departure from the Runway XXC on the west side of the runway and inadvertently read back a line up and wait clearance for another aircraft. As we approached the end of the runway; the Captain called out; 'I see a sign with XXC.' I responded that I concurred. An air carrier flight was in front of us; and as it was cleared for take-off; we pulled up to the hold short line and stopped. We were the only aircraft in the number one position at the end of the runway; there was nobody across the runway waiting to depart from the east side; just us and a few aircraft behind us; and XXC was not being used for landings; just departures. As I was completing the runway identification process; in accordance with the Operations Manual I absolutely believed I heard Tower clear us to line up and wait Runway XXC and I read back the clearance on the Tower's frequency. The Captain called for the line-up checklist and started to advance the thrust levers. As the nose of the aircraft crossed the hold short line somebody transmitted on the Tower frequency and said 'who's taking the runway?' This immediately raised a red flag; and before I could say anything; the Captain brought the aircraft to an abrupt stop. We were barely across the hold short line; and nowhere near the runway edge when I believe the Tower said something to the effect of 'Whose number one at XXC?' I replied with our flight number and stated; 'You cleared us to line up and wait on XXC.' The Tower Controller replied; 'Actually; I cleared another flight (behind us) to line up and wait on XXC; but if you're number one for the runway line up and wait; Runway XXC.' Once again; I read back the clearance; 'Line up and wait Runway XXC; [flight number].' We taxied into position on Runway XXC and upon being cleared for take-off from Runway XXC; completed the Line-Up checklist and departed uneventfully. In retrospect; expectation bias was clearly in play. Beyond that; I absolutely believed I heard our call sign being cleared to line up and wait; and did not consider the possibility that the Tower had inadvertently cleared the aircraft behind us to line up and wait. Interestingly; both of us were positive that the clearance was for us; so checking with the other pilot would not have yielded a different result; except that maybe we would have heard the aircraft behind us query the Tower since they were number two. In the words of the Captain; this was a wake-up call for both of us to ensure we are more alert to all clearances and transmissions on the frequency.Bottom line; I made a mistake; and erroneously responded to another aircraft's clearance. Clearly; I need to either stop running checklists; and complying with procedures; and listen to the radio every time a transmission occurs; or do a better job of dividing my attention between listening to the radio and performing my operational duties.

I taxied right on to what I thought was S; but after making the turn we both noticed that we had actually turned onto Taxiway RG instead.  We then made the left turn onto A and continued on our instructions without further incident and Ground Control did not comment on any wrongdoing. I believe the taxiway confusion first began with the initial change from getting a new taxi route from ATC to join A from parallel B. Usually going to [Runway] 4L; the aircraft would be given Taxiways B to D; but with taxiway construction; parts of B and D were unusable.

I was looking north for the VFR aircraft I took the point out on looking away from Runway 8. I looked back to Aircraft X in position and saw Aircraft Y on 1 mile final for Runway 08. I looked at the data tag on the radar screen and instructed Aircraft Y to go around twice with no response. I instructed Aircraft X to exit Runway 08 at alpha two intersection. Alpha two taxiway is approx 500 feet from the full length Runway 8. Aircraft Y continued on the approach to Runway 8 and landed passed the displaced threshold approximately 4500 feet down the runway exited the runway and checked on ground.

Aircraft Y never checked in on the tower frequency and was never issued a landing clearance.

973,973,973,973,1920,Planned for a Part 91 flight with two passengers from BTM. Events leading to the takeoff roll were normal and included at least 3 radio transmissions over CTAF; including one to the Cessna (Aircraft Y). The specific communication related to our intent to depart the area to the west; as was he; and our respective separation enroute. I responded that we would be well out of his way. We started our takeoff roll on Runway 33. Another Cessna (Aircraft Z) was taxing along the parallel taxiway and the first Cessna (Aircraft Y) radioed that he would be taxing to Runway 29. After the 80 KT callout we both noticed that a Cessna was moving quickly and about to cross our runway on Taxiway D (approximately 4;000-4;500 FT from our departure end). The Pilot Flying (Captain) initiated an early rotation at approximately 90-95 KTS as the pilot not flying (First Officer) increased torque to about 120%. The airplane lifted off sluggishly; but in control. The Pilot Flying altered course slightly to the left and behind the Cessna. I (First Officer) saw the airplane to my right on the centerline of our runway with a vertical and lateral separation of 50 FT or less as we crossed Taxiway D airborne.

974,974,974,974,1144,The incident took place at the end of a relatively quick flight [inter island] to Honolulu. On final approach we were given instructions to plan for a long roll out on Runway 4R.On previous operations into Honolulu; we have consistently been given two options for vacating Runway 4R; either: taxi to the end; turn right on Taxiway C; and hold short of Runway 8L; or turn right onto Runway 8L; then right onto Taxiway C. Our instructions for a long roll out matched the first option.However; just before reaching Taxiway E and while still at relatively high speed; we were suddenly asked if we could make the turnoff onto Taxiway E. Due to our high speed we were unable and declined. We were then told to taxi to the end onto Taxiway C and then hold short of Runway 8L. The controller then informed us that an air carrier aircraft was on final for Runway 8L with a LAHSO clearance to hold short of Runway 4R. Although LAHSO operations are prohibited in our operation (which we declared on initial contact with Approach Control); this was understood to mean that the air carrier aircraft would land short of the Runway 4R intersection. Finally; just prior to crossing the intersection of Runway 4R/8L; the Controller then gave us what sounded like a second set of instructions to make 2 right turns.The late request by Tower to clear on E; the update on the landing aircraft; and what was perceived as a new set of instructions; all combined to create the impression that Tower wanted us off Runway 4R at the earliest opportunity. As a result; we erroneously interpreted these new instructions to mean the controller wanted us to change to the alternative option for vacating from Runway 4R; by turning right onto Runway 8L and then right again onto Taxiway C. Although we asked the Tower to 'confirm turn right now'; there was no reply. Due to our proximity to this turn-off; an immediate decision had to be made; and in an attempt to provide the Tower with what we perceived they wanted; we vacated onto Runway 8L and quickly onto Taxiway C.It is apparent that there was a communications issue between the Tower and our aircraft. In retrospect; it would have been better to simply continue with the original rollout plan following the initial instructions; and decline any further deviation without receiving absolute clarification of Tower's meaning.However; rather than cause for blame; there are probably human factors lessons which can be learnt from this: if no further communications were made to us during a high workload phase when attention should be focused on aircraft control; we would have landed and vacated without any issue. Although ATC had good intentions by stating the landing aircraft's position; telling us that they had a LAHSO clearance to hold short of Runway 4R made the second set of instructions to us seem more reasonable. As stated above; we are not trained for LAHSO and in this instance a confused situation developed. One would not expect that a second set of instructions would be exactly like the first and during this critical phase of flight; we thought ATC wanted us to execute the second option that is often given to us after landing on 4R.In the end; we were trying to do the right thing and thought that we were helping ATC by expediting off of the runway environment. We are all human and understand very well the demands placed on ATC and flight crews every day in this dynamic environment we operate in.

978,978,978,978,4419,In ZZZ we were given the instructions to taxi XX to the intersection of XXR and XX1 for takeoff. While on XX1 at the hold short line for XXR the FO (First Officer) said; 'You are on XX2 not XX1;' I looked up and did see an XX2 location sign out to my left; at this time we were cleared to line up and wait from XX1; which added a bit of urgency; I immediately repositioned on the next taxi way over where the FO had pointed to; and entered the runway from there. We lined up and took off without incident; ATC didn't say anything about it; but the whole thing didn't seem right and once we got to altitude I reviewed the taxi diagram again; and recalled a couple of other things. We had absolutely been on the correct taxi way; XX1; the first time; I had even remembered saying while on XX; 'Here is X20; XX1 is next;' and then being at that taxiway behind another aircraft which was cleared to takeoff from XX1. So the FO was incorrect and we actually moved from XX1 (the correct taxiway) to XX2 (the incorrect taxiway) when we did what he said. The reason we saw the XX2 location sign was because it was between XX1 and XX2; so we were not actually on XX2. I absolutely believe my incorrect response to the FO's allegation was 99% fatigue related.I had a day trip; a four day; and another day trip lined up for a total of six days on and this happened on the last leg of day six. The four day in the middle was mentally and physically exhausting; and after two close to minimum rest overnights; I started my day-trip on day six with an early morning turn; then a two and a half hour sit with an ZZZ turn left to go. I considered calling in fatigued on the sit due to how out-of-it and exhausted I was feeling; but after grabbing a cup of coffee I felt decent and decided to press on; only to find out when I got to the plane that the FO I would be doing the last two legs with was on his first leg off of IOE (Initial Operational Experience). I'd been expecting a senior FO; so at this revelation I immediately regretted not calling in fatigued; which in hind sight; is the wrong approach to take to fatigue. Whether or not I call in fatigued should not be based on who I am flying with; I should not expect a senior FO to carry part of my weight or 'keep an eye on me;' I'm either fit to fly or I am not; and if I'm not alert enough to fly with a brand new FO then I'm not alert enough to be flying. At this point calling in fatigued would have no doubt meant delaying passengers and the crew; which I try to be considerate of and avoid; but in the interest of safety I should not have let it stop me from calling in fatigued either.Had I not been exhausted and already a little on edge from a couple of stupid little things I did from being so worn out (like trying to taxi with the parking brake on); then immediately swooping over to the next taxiway; just because someone who has been on the line for two weeks told me it was the right one with confidence; would not EVER have been my response. I know much better than this and I feel my normal response to this situation would have been to tell tower we needed a minute; and for the FO and I to review the taxi diagram and our location together. The intersection we did takeoff from gave us more runway; so it was not a performance hazard in this instance; but it was still a deviation from an ATC clearance and could have been worse.Fatigue was the main factor for this incident. Some other minor factors were that I am a newer captain; in my three months as captain it has just worked out that I have worked with mainly senior FOs and other reserve captains (which isn't to say that a senior person couldn't have made the new FOs mistake; just that I need to make sure I don't let working with experienced/knowledgeable pilots allow me to develop complacency when it comes to listening to the person I'm working with; we BOTH need to stop and see regardless of their experience level).I've flown while tired; but this is thefirst time I've ever flown fatigued; I learned a lot from it and absolutely won't hesitate to call off fatigued in the future if I think I'm nearing this point.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
979,979,979,979,9902,I was pilot flying from the right seat (SIC) on a day time ferry flight to 42J. On the way; we reviewed the airport diagram; NOTAMs; etc. since this was an unfamiliar field for both of us. The PIC pointed out that Runway 5-23 was closed. This was the longer; wider and preferred runway of the two available. So; 11-29 was our only option to land. The winds were favoring 29.This runway was 4;900 FT and change by 75 FT; very close to the operating limitations for the Citation X. First red flag. The PIC also read a bullet point for Runway 11-29 that stated that the maximum weight for that runway was 12;500 LBS. 2nd red flag. He called Dispatch; because at this time; we were both ready to divert instead. Dispatch called down to 42J; and the Operations Manager there said that it's OK to land on 11-29; despite the note. 3rd red flag.We pressed on and planned to land on Runway 29. After being vectored around the restricted area by Jacksonville Center; we had the field in sight; canceled IFR; and proceeded toward a left base for 29. On short final; we noticed orange flags; or cones; across the runway; just past the beginning of the runway. We saw work trucks off to the left. A voice came on UNICOM; and asked if we knew about the displaced threshold? The PIC answered that we did; since we both could see the flags/cones across the runway. That; to us; was the displaced threshold. We landed just beyond the flags/cones uneventfully; rolled out normally; and taxied into the FBO. The Airport Manager parked us; and then told us that we landed about 800 FT short of the displaced threshold.Up until this point; the PIC and I had no idea that we did anything wrong. Looking back on it; as soon as those orange flags/cones came into sight; I wasn't really looking beyond that. The runway was short and narrow; and I was focused on landing and getting the airplane stopped. The displaced threshold markings did not stand out at all. But; we looked at the NOTAMs again and found that the last one stated a displaced threshold 1;160 FT for Runway 29.This was absolutely not intentional; but could've easily been avoided. I honestly don't think we should even be going into 42J until they reopen 5-23. If 11-29 is really OK to land on; then; the bullet point of 12;500 LBS maximum should be taken off the chart. Gainesville; FL was a stone's throw away. Most importantly; we should have read the NOTAMs more carefully. We probably should have landed on Runway 11; and rolled into the displacement. The displaced threshold at 42J was hard to pick up. Maybe installing REILS at the displacement will make it more noticeable.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
980,980,980,980,43,I was flying Aircraft X.  The aircraft had it's Navigation lights; rotating beacon; wingtip strobes and Landing/Taxi Lights activated at the time of the incident.  There was 1 passenger on board.  I was in the pattern for runway XX at ZZZ. Before turning base; I made a radio call on CTAF that 'Cessna Cardinal is turning base for runway XX at ZZZ'. While turning base I observed a white cargo van with an amber flashing light on the roof entering the airport from an access road onto Taxiway Charlie. I made another radio call on CTAF 'a Cessna Cardinal is turning final runway XX touch and go ZZZ.'  The white van proceeded on Taxiway Charlie to Taxiway Alpha.  As the van turn on to Taxiway Alpha; I made another radio call on CTAF 'Cardinal short final runway XX; ZZZ.'  The aircraft was at about 50 feet AGL about to across the runway threshold when I made that radio call.  I touched down at about the 1;000 foot marks.  I observed the white van slow down near the hold short lines for the intersection of Taxiway Alpha and Runway YY/XX.  As I was rolling out passing Taxiway Delta; the white van accelerated across Runway YY/XX.  I applied heavy braking to slow the closing distance between my aircraft and the white van.  The van was approximately 600 feet in front of me when it crossed the runway.  The white van never made any radio calls while on the airport property.

981,981,981,981,8582,I was acting as pilot (PIC) of my bonanza BE36; with my neighbor as co-pilot; on an IFR. My co-pilot was handling radio transmissions and requested and cleared for the ILS approach by Approach. We were then instructed to contact tower. When the co-pilot contacted tower; we were on a 5 - 6 mile final on the ILS approach. Tower informed us that we were number 2 following a Skyhawk and cleared us to land runway 14. The co-pilot then read back our landing instructions which included our call sign. The landing roll took us past taxiway D and I was slowing the aircraft to decide which taxiway to exit for [FBO]. By now; I was approaching runway 4 and the co-pilot turned to the right in time to see a Twin Piper on take-off roll. Since there are no brakes on the right; the co-pilot told me to STOP!! STOP!! STOP!! When I stopped; the aircraft was inside of the runway 04 edge line. I immediately turned to my right; and saw the Twin Piper on take-off roll. Coinciding with the above; the tower instructed the Twin Piper to abort the take-off. The pilot of the Twin aircraft did not abort the take-off; did not acknowledge the towers instruction to abort the take-off and became airborne. The twin passed us with approximately three feet of altitude and within fifteen feet of the nose of our Bonanza. By the time the abort take-off was issued by the tower; a collision with the Twin Piper would have been inevitable had we not stopped. Both the speed of the Twin and his lack of altitude when passing in front of us; only reaffirms my opinion that a collision would have been unavoidable. We were then given runway exit instructions by the tower to initially turn right onto runway 04. This was then amended to continue to taxiway Bravo; right turn. Ground control then cleared us to taxi to [FBO] via Taxiway Alpha; hold short Runway 04 - 22. We were then given clearance to cross runway 4; and proceed to [FBO].The tower should never have issued a take-off clearance to an aircraft departing a crossing runway without issuing and receiving confirmation of a land and hold short instruction of that crossing runway to landing aircraft.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
982,982,982,982,1033,Enroute to ZZZ we received our original gate assignment. We briefed the taxi route during the approach briefing and the Captain (CA) were both very familiar with ZZZ airport and taxi routes as we both come here often. We landed and had a short taxi ahead of us. We exited the runway and contacted ground. We were told [to wait]. I read this back and verbalized it to the CA and mentioned something about a gate change. I also noticed that we had a message from the station about a gate change while completing the after landing checklist (must have been inhibited during approach because we didn't receive the 'ACARS' EICAS message until after landing). While taxing in we taxied past K; we stopped the airplane and told ground that we missed K. They asked us to hold short of L while another aircraft moved; we then were instructed to taxi L; B; K to stand. I'm not sure why we missed K but I think it was a combination of confirmation bias and I fatigue. We had expected a certain route and even though it changed we still executed the original pan. I think we were both extremely tired and I honestly may have had a moment of micro sleep at the moment we taxied past K. This was an un-augmented flight that left ZZZ1 at XR00. By the time we were taxiing in it was XA00 body time with no rest or break. I slept well the night before and had an afternoon nap before the flight and I was still wiped out.

985,985,985,985,2749,Flight was enroute when cleared to descend to 7;000 feet MSL from cruise at 9;000 feet MSL. There was no significant moonlight. The aircraft entered IMC at cloud tops at approximately 8;000 feet MSL; which could be determined by the strobes. After leveling off; Center contacted the crew and advised that [destination] had just closed Runway XX/XY due to low braking action. Center advised that company requested a diversion to [an alternate airport].Captain was Pilot Flying (PF). At this time; it was observed that ice had accumulated on the aircraft at a faster rate than forecast by approved sources at the time of departure. It was also determined at this time that the aircraft front window deicing panel/plate had become ineffective in preventing ice accumulation; which had not been immediately noticeable in the dark IMC. Accurate forward visibility was therefore not determinable; although some ice/frost accumulation was observable on the forward aircraft windows.PF considered multiple factors; including; but not limited to; cockpit resources needed to reconfigure for an approach at [a company-recommended alternate]; field familiarity; ASOS weather reports; NexRad displays; airport lighting facilities to appropriate runways; ARFF and emergency resources available; and crew experience. PF is an FAA-licensed ATP single-engine sea pilot; and is highly experienced with zero braking action operations in this type aircraft. PF had operated at [destination airport] earlier in the day and was familiar with how it had been cleared of snow and where runway plow furls were located; etc. Crew was not familiar with the conditions at [the company-recommended alternate] throughout this day of relatively extreme winter weather.Concurrent with these events; moderate rime ice had begun to accumulate on the aircraft in addition to the indeterminable restricted forward visibility. PF opted to trade altitude for necessary continued airspeed; engage all available deicing equipment and to continue as planned (and previously loaded in nav systems) to a MALSR-illuminated Runway at [original destination]; with which he is highly familiar.Approach was properly stabilized and landing was made without abnormality nor incident. Taxiing was also without abnormality or incident. The only unusual announcement by crew was that passengers were advised to proceed with caution on the airport ramp due to ice on the ground. Passengers only commented on the poor weather and several thanked the crew for the flight. Aircraft was properly secured on ramp.

989,989,989,989,6832,I and my instructor had completed run-up at Runway 12 and announced our roll on Runway 12 with left crosswind departure. All traffic; including an inbound jet at about 6 nm northwest were using or planning to use Runway 12. Once we were rolling on Runway 12; Aircraft Y that had not yet been on frequency; announced 4 mile final straight in for Runway 30 (note that Runway 12 is the calm-wind runway; and the wind was calm). I presume Aircraft Y had been with TUS TRACON until that time; then switched to advisory and announced intentions without taking existing traffic at AVQ into account. I aborted my takeoff roll on Runway 12 and announced that I would return to the run-up area for Runway 12 (back-taxi; since that was the quickest option to clear the runway from where I was). Once on the ground on Runway 30; Aircraft Y announced 'clear of 30' while still rolling on the runway. I am convinced that my action to abort takeoff might have prevented an accident. I am also convinced that the pilot of Aircraft Y either did not fully appreciate the situation or was operating under the belief that being in a fast jet exempted him from following proper procedures. Related to this; AVQ is an accident waiting to happen; especially during this week every year when the pattern is loaded with corporate jets for an annual event.

990,990,990,990,1706,I was leaving ZZZ where I am based to do practice landings [another airport]. Taxing out of the [parking area] I stopped and requested XX because the sock suggested it was slightly favored; although most the wind was across the runway. The controller indicated that it was unavailable due to pattern work on 28R and I believe offered me 33R or XY before issuing a clearance. I began taxiing to 33R via X-Y. As I approached the XY threshold; I was unclear in my head whether I had been cleared to cross XY and initiated braking. Due to a significant tailwind; the braking was less effective than anticipated and I pushed harder on the brakes; which caused the tail to leave the ground and the prop to strike the taxiway. This initial strike occurred before the hold short line.After the initial strike I believe I let my feet off the brakes briefly before pushing them even harder; which caused a second prop strike and the aircraft to roll up on its nose. The aircraft came to a stop roughly 10-15 feet past the hold short line. In conversation with the ATC supervisor; who had reviewed the tapes; I was told later that in fact I had been cleared to XY via X-Y. This came as a surprise to me; as the question in my mind was whether or not I had been cleared to cross or asked to hold short; which was my expectation of what the controller would have said explicitly relative to the past when a clearance to 33R would have implied a clearance to cross XY. This confusion leads me to believe that the sequence of runways discussed; plus the aircraft that was already in the pattern on 33R caused me to 'hear' something different that was actually said. I'm not sure what would have been better from a clarification perspective other than if I had heard 'hold short' 33R but that would have been non-standard for a clearance to 33R. I believe that my familiarity with the airport was actually a hindrance in this case as it may have led to my being less vigilant than would be typical if I were unfamiliar.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

992,992,992,992,8705,I had just completed position relief giving the position to another controller when Aircraft X reported clear of runway 13R. I had never spoken to Aircraft X therefore he landed without a landing clearance. At this time of the morning DFW airport was conducting their daily runway inspections. Runway 13R had already been inspected; Runway 18L was closed and being inspected. We had a layer of scattered to broken clouds at 1600-1800 and it was quite windy. The sun was rising and visibility was poor at best due to the glare off the window shades. Final Monitor was open. Aircraft spacing on final was 3-4 miles and speeds slow due to the high wind. Just prior to beginning position relief I had planned to depart an aircraft from Runway 18R between a heavy and an regional jet because approach was providing 6 mile spacing due to the wake turbulence. I briefed my plan to my relief. I never saw Aircraft X on final to Runway 13R and do not recall the FLM telling me that approach had called to coordinate a 13R arrival which is our normal practice due to the impact of the CRO (Converging Runway Operation) operation on departures. One final thought: 13R is behind the tower. Due to having a quick turn last night and the fact that all the traffic was on 18L and 18R; I was sitting on position which I only do when I am tired and/or the traffic is light. I wouldn't recommend opening our second Local just to handle one airplane but my being anchored to a chair didn't help me scan the area as well as I would have liked. Sitting isn't a factor in not seeing an aircraft on the final on the radar; but one does get into a routine at times and tunnel vision is a possibility. There are no procedures in place to transfer radar data of arrivals from the TRACON to the tower. At my previous facility we were to ensure that all arrivals were on a tower data block prior to communications transfer. In addition to avoiding a surprise because the tower did not quick look approach data blocks; this practice also gave control of the radar data to the tower; should they need to change anything or do a handoff. It also kept it clear who was responsible for providing separation for those aircraft. And; that was back in ARTS. Today; we have STARS at DFW so there is another benefit of putting the arrivals on a tower data block - they would be white instead of green like every other data block on the radar. I think this would have increased my situational awareness because I simply wasn't looking for anyone on the 13R final. Just a few minutes earlier and this could have been a tragedy with 5 vehicles on 13R conducting a runway inspection. While that is not very likely because I had put the X on 13R when the airport closed it; I also didn't need a go around in the middle of that push either.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

As the taxiing Aircraft X turned north; I lined Aircraft Y up on the runway. With my plan firmly in my head; I would depart Aircraft Y then I would allow Aircraft X to cross the runway 4 at a taxiway. When the ground controller coordinated the crossing; I had my plan made and did not realize the crossing was before Aircraft Y. I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff. The aircraft rotated and was airborne before the taxiway. The ASDE-X alerted.

After they took position; they were cleared for take off. Shortly thereafter; their take off clearance was canceled because of traffic crossing down field. They were reissued a take off clearance; and we were given; 'Line up and wait; traffic four-mile final.' As we finished lining up; the Tower Controller excitedly said something about C2 to the North; and did not wait for a response. The Controller asked another carrier to move up to allow room because he was blocking C2. We queried if we were cleared for take off or not; and the controller said no; to clear the runway to the North on C2. As we were clearing; the controller sent the traffic on final around.

998,998,998,998,10189,I was in the process of aircraft shopping. I arranged for a test flight with the owner once I'd inspected the aircraft on the ramp. We agreed that he would fly; while I would monitor engine instrumentation/performance. We planned a few trips around the pattern. We taxied to Runway 34 and did run ups in preparation for departure. I asked for several additional items above and beyond the standard mag/carb heat checks. During that time; two other aircraft were talking on the CTAF which is shared with several area airports.  The PIC made the appropriate CTAF departure call and lined up on 34. We began our departure; and upon rotation; we heard a call 'XXXXX; uhh; vacating Runway 16?' We passed nearly directly overhead of the aircraft which had been preparing to depart 16; missing by about 30 feet vertically. The PIC banked to the right after a few seconds. The PIC and I were shaken; and we confirmed with one another that neither of us had heard any previous calls from the aircraft. The sun angle was such that it was difficult to see to from the 34 end of the runway to the 16 end. Additionally; both the PIC and I were distracted by the sales process and the long run-up checks.

1002,1002,1002,1002,5734,When I got in on the MID; the sectors were already combined at ZZZ and there were several things to do. I stayed busy for almost an hour and a half and was just managing to keep my head above water. These sectors should not have been combined. Period. We have a 4-12 shift to keep someone at work during this time to keep the highs split out from the lows and I was told the Supervisor let them go home on leave. While working the traffic I was told by area 2 that 'ZZZ1 was open'. Unlike our area; they still had highs open; super highs open and split. So in other words; during the same busy period; they had four controllers in working the sectors adjacent mine; where I was working alone and I would argue that I had more traffic at the time.ZZZ1 was yelling over at me because I had just violated them with Aircraft X. This was truly an unsafe situation and violating ZZZ1 sector was minor compared to what could have happened. The Supervisor simply left in the middle of this after taking one handoff and telling ZZZ2 to keep the next one coming.

He stated that he had seen neither depart. BKW is part of CRW Approach; but ZID owns 110 and above over BKW. I called CRW Approach and they verified that both VIP aircraft were still on the ground. Do we extend the TFR? CRW Approach said yes. So I verified that we would extend the TFR until further advised.

We had the previous TFR that had expired in our information. After having worked the sector for an hour; we kept getting reports from SoCal that the TFR is more in our sky than theirs; and our coordination on arriving aircraft was getting confusing because our maps were not showing the same information. I remembered our CIC had said earlier that they didn't want to read all the NOTAMs for the watch check list because there were too many. Eventually; I asked SoCal of the position of the TFR to make sure we have the correct display; and ours was incorrect. I asked our CIC to find out if our TFR was correct; and they told me to look it up (despite working traffic at the time). I looked up the NOTAM; and then corrected the drawing for our TFR and input the drawing on all the other scopes as needed; and updated our information area as for the new drawing.I'm not sure if anyone had gone through the TFR before I updated the drawings.I would have the CIC's get training on the desk and duties involved; and stress the need to make sure the NOTAMs are up to date or corrected.

I was operating with the airport manager's permission and she was aware of the date and time I would be flying. No NOTAM was published for this flight. As a Part 107 and a Part 61 pilot based at ZZZ; I am familiar with airport operations; layout; and traffic patterns and was careful to avoid all safety conflicts and not violate 107.37 or 107.43. Runway XX was the runway currently in use and left traffic for that runway was well away from where I was flying; with the exception for one helicopter in the pattern flying right traffic; which overflies the building I was photographing.The helicopter traffic is at 500 feet AGL in that pattern; and I was doing my drone operation generally under 100 feet AGL; and at the absolute maximum I was at 180 feet AGL roughly. The company hangar is in front of the building I was photographing and while flying I heard their helicopter spooling up; and not knowing which way they may turn when they took off from their hangar; I landed the drone and waited until after they departed before flying again. Once I was back in the air; a company employee on the ground called the helicopter in the pattern to tell them 'some guy is flying a drone' over the building. I was operating with lights on my truck from inside the airport perimeter fence and at no point did the company employee approach me to ask who I was. After their exchange I got on the radio to clarify my operations and eliminate any concern to the helicopter pilots. Once I was done with my flight I made a radio call that I was on the ground and that drone operations were completed. I was later informed that company had been sending around a photo of me to airport tenants trying to figure out who I was.After the helicopter landed I called the pilot to apologize if it had caused any concern and he assured me that no safety concern was present to him at any time. I then called the airport manager (who was offsite) to mention what had happened so that she would be aware in case anything came up. She spoke to company and informed me that the miscommunication was all squared away; and that in retrospect; a NOTAM should be filed next time. Later in the day; two company employees drove over to where I was on the airport to express their concern and frustration. I assured them that given their proximity to where I was flying; I made sure to be on the ground when they were departing and that I was never in the air anywhere close to their aircraft. Regardless they informed me that despite the pilot of the helicopter in the pattern and a nearby FAA safety representative seeing no concern; they had filed a safety report to the FSDO.

Pilot safely and legally launched; and subsequently landed; a drone (UAS) from the New York State side of the Falls with most of the flight taking place over the American Falls; also located on the New York State side. While in the course of this carefully planned; and safe; controlled flight over Niagara Falls; pilot failed to recognize the exact part of the airspace over the Horseshoe Falls that is actually in Canadian Airspace. This was realized after the flight was concluded and verified with mapping on the DJI Go app; which records the sequence of flight.  Also; it is believed the altitudes indicated during flight were not accurate even after the UAS was properly calibrated over a grass surface. Some of the recorded altitudes indicate higher than 400 AGL and believe this may be a composite measurement of the launch point altitude of 614 feet MSL and the drop off over the falls descending to as low as 167 feet below that; indicating an MSL altitude of 447 feet.

1014,1014,1014,1014,7368,While working sectors combined; weather was building in and around the sector. Sectors were stratified and we were supposed to be getting 15 miles in trail. As the sector started to get busy I asked the Supervisor if we are supposed to be getting the posted in trail and if not to increase it and make sure we get it. The Supervisor walked over to monitor the situation and did nothing. As the sector got busier; I told the Supervisor that this is not working and asked to have the sector split. By the time someone came to split the sector it was too late to split. There was a heavy departure and arrival push with what seemed to be no in trail at all using two different frequencies. I lost command of the frequencies due to pilots stepping over each other requesting deviations. In my estimation I almost had about 3 maybe 4 losses of separation and not sure if any airspace violations. At which point I told my Assist to call all the TRACONs and tell them to terminate all VFR aircraft and spin all aircraft that were airborne and we are not taking any more handoffs until the sector gets under control. My assist was a developmental and was doing the best he could with coordination. The lack of sufficient TMU (Traffic Management Unit) initiatives and enforcement combined with the sectors not being split in a timely fashion led to this event. Why it happened I'm not sure but it is becoming an all too common event.This being the 3rd time this has happened to me; I would recommend revising stratification procedures as there is nothing in place for satellite airports that I am aware of. I would also recommend investigating why TMU and management are not proactive in implementing necessary procedures to facilitate a safe operation.

I lost contact with the tower on remaining radio.I am not sure if I changed transponder code while in Class D airspace or as I entered into Class G. My knobs on transponder are analog and I switched knobs to what I thought was 7600. I finished recycling both Nav/coms and noticed I was quickly approaching Class D airspace of the adjacent airport.A climb was initiated to get over 2800 feet to avoid Class D; but in my estimation I would not make it over 2800 feet so I turned west to avoid Class D. Next portion of flight was to a small airport which has parachute jumping so I overflew field to look for the distinctive colors of the aircraft on the ground so as not to cause harm to any parachutists.I started my approach while a call was made to the office at my home airport to advise of electrical problem; however; the answering machine came on.There indeed was no power as I could not get the electrically powered flaps to deploy and committed to a no flap landing.When the office manager gave me a number to call to speak to TRACON I explained the foregoing as I did not realize the transponder was reading 7500 rather than 7600 along with flying the aircraft being first priority. I will make it my practice to confirm transponder settings more often as time permits.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1019,1019,1019,1019,7020,I was working Camrn/Lendy position in the Kennedy Sector of the NY TRACON. We were in the middle of our daily afternoon push and I was feeding Final position the SOP feed for Runway 22L/22R approach. We were busy so we had just put ZNY Camrn Sector; and ZNY Water Sector in a hold and were running traffic from ZNY Lendy Sector. I had numerous IFR traffic on my frequency all descending to the same altitude on radar vectors assigned by me to put in line to feed the Final Controller. I received an extremely loud high pitched tone through my headset. I yelled 'OW' and the Final Controller then looked at me and said 'you heard that too?' I told him I did and we both then realized our frequencies were no longer working. The other two positions in the area did not receive the tone and their frequencies kept working. At this point; I called the Lendy Sector and told them to hold because we lost frequencies. I then proceeded to try our backup jacks and backup frequencies. I was able to get my frequency to work and then proceeded to stop aircraft descents so that I had altitude between all aircraft. The Final Controller's frequency still wasn't working; and neither was LGA Final Controller's; which is a big deal due the finals being right next to each other at the same altitude. Since Final still didn't have a frequency I began to spin the aircraft in my airspace. The Rober position also took some aircraft from me to spin in their airspace so that I had no planes at the same altitude. In the course of planes being vectored; altitudes maintained; I may have entered LIB SOUTH and ZNY airspace; although it did not cause a loss of separation between any aircraft. I don't know why we lost frequencies; but if they figure out why; maybe they could change it so that LGA FINAL and JFK FINAL are on two different sources so that they don't lose them at the same time. The proximity of the finals is dangerous enough as it is.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1020,1020,1020,1020,8124,I was working a Navajo inbound to Merrill Field from the northwest. The weather was IFR at Anchorage International but VFR at Merrill; and the pilot requested the GPS-A Approach to MRI. When the Navajo was about 10 miles from YOHOE (IF); I cleared him for his approach into Merrill. I was watching the South Controller who was working a Beech 1900 in sequence to Anchorage International for the ILS Runway 7L. The Beech 1900 was on; basically; an opposing base to the Navajo; though to different airports; the IF and FAF's are closely spaced so I was keeping an eye on how close they would get. YOHOE is placed only about 2.5 miles from the ANC 7L/7R finals. Knowing they are close; I looked at the Beech 1900 on right base descending to 1;600 from 3;000 FT. I noted the Beech 1900's speed and saw he was not going to be ahead of the Navajo at YOHOE to sufficiently stay 3 miles away from him; so I canceled and re-cleared the Navajo to intercept the GPS-A to MRI inside YOHOE which would ensure we kept 3 miles between our two finals. I brought this to the attention of the South Controller who was watching the situation evolve as well. The Navajo took the new approach clearance and flew a few miles before went right through the final approach course for the GPS-A to MRI and continued on the 090 degrees heading I gave him to intercept. This put him back on a converging course with the Beech 1900 abeam him; on final for ANC 7L ILS; at the same altitude and less than 3 miles away; I'm guessing about 2.5 miles or so. As the Navajo 'went through' I told the South Controller about it and he immediately canceled the Beech 1900's approach clearance and turned them south for re-sequencing as I turned the Navajo to a 040 heading to join the GPS-A final approach course. Wake turbulence was not an issue. Visual separation would not have been an option as an 'out' because we were IFR in that area with -SN 1SM advertised visibility and RVR's. It would be nice if either YOHOE was moved closer to RICKR so it didn't impede on the ANC final(s) or create a new fix altogether that was closer to RICKR to prevent this kind of set-up for conflict. Also; I could have and should have just cleared the Navajo north of YOHOE on an intercept closer to RICKR so that if he did go through; I wouldn't lose separation with the ANC final!,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

He had accidentally dropped the track of Aircraft X instead of the intended arrival; but didn't realize it. At the time I signed in to take the sector; the limited Data Block of Aircraft X was at the boundary leaving my airspace and I didn't notice it. I remember Aircraft X calling me later to ask for a higher altitude. I did not remember working him; so I pulled up his Flight Plan and ran a route line to see where he was. The route line came up in the middle of the adjacent sector's airspace; and I saw the call sign in the limited Data Block next to the route line; so I sent him to that sector's frequency (Sector 16). Since dropping a Data Block is so easy to do and can cause such an unsafe condition; it might help to make dropping Data Blocks have the same procedure as removing a flight plan; where a /OK entry is required.

1024,1024,1024,1024,7981,I was just on departures and watched everything. Aircraft X was descending towards the initial approach fix during simultaneous ILS approach operations at IAD. The final was busy as was the approach sector who handed him off missing many VFR targets not talking to flying all through our arrivals and the final. One VFR [aircraft] flying west to east level at 3;000 feet flew right through the final just outside the Bravo and Aircraft X who was descending to the same altitude responded to a TCAS RA to miss him. The VFR target was hard to see with all the busy traffic for the west final over top of his tag; and the final was busy. This happens all the time.We need to extend the Bravo to encompass our finals. FDK airport is just under about a 25 mile final to IAD when we are in a south operation. Our simulate SOP dictates we must go out to just south of FDK but usually get pushed out farther at 3;000 feet. This means aircraft fly into the Bravo; past the airport; then back out again; not just out of the lower limits; but out of the lateral confines of the bravo all together. Furthermore; the SFRA causes almost every single GA aircraft on the East Coast that wants to fly into the Northeast corridor (PHL; NYC; BOS area and beyond) and avoid having to talk to ATC or file and SFRA flight plan to all fly around it over the same spot. This is right over FDK. There are far too many little VFR [aircraft] that we aren't talking to that we are constantly trying to dodge flying right through our finals and arrivals. Even when we are north; we have two major STARs that fly right over FDK. The Bravo needs to extend out to encompass the FDK area to push these aircraft out of the way.

1025,1025,1025,1025,4589,I was working R35. I was required to give 15 Miles in Trail to LAS; 10 Miles in Trail to LAX and turbulence was reported at many of my altitudes. The traffic volume and complexity were low; but my attention was definitely required. I had noticed activity going on around my physical self but wasn't sure exactly what was happening. I knew that sector 08 was being moved to sector 53 for what I assumed was for tech ops activity on the MID shift. Sector 08's traffic began to be handed off to my sector which was confusing and it also made me suspect that the combine sector message input by the Front Line Manager (FLM) had opened sector 53; which was my airspace. I voiced this concern to the FLM and did not get a response. Configuration at the time Sector 53 was combined at Sector 35. I needed to ship an aircraft to sector 08 but was concerned that the correct frequencies were not assigned to sector 53 since this has been a problem in the past. I was also still concerned about 53 not being assigned to my sector so I asked the FLM '... can you explain to us what is going on with our sectors?'. He angrily told me 'You know what's going on!'. I was taken aback by his response and was frankly worried additional questioning would result in further hostility. I knew my priority was to resolve these situations but I was at a loss as to what to do. Then Sector 36 displayed a datablock to what should have been my sector; but it populated at Sector 53. Sector 36 and Sector 53 reported this behavior to the FLM. The FLM proceeded to enter approximately 5 combine sector messages into the system experimenting with our sectors to try to find the right message. This action made me very uncomfortable; more than I already was. The problem wasn't resolved and I advised the FLM that I was not comfortable working the sector with half of the airspace assigned to another controller. He ordered us to go into the MID configuration. I'm not sure what to advise; other than to train FLM's to be more cautious and deliberate when inputting sector messages. This is not the first time this FLM has disregarded safety and the well-being of the operation in our area. This FLM's anger was also very distracting and uncomfortable; not a position I like to be put in when I am responsible for the safety of aircraft.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1027,1027,1027,1027,430,Upon being seated in the hotel van; the van driver showed me a piece of paper with 'MLS Tower' and an area code and phone number and told me that I should call that number. This was the first indication of anything possibly going wrong with our flight. As per Union instruction; I did not call the number. When I arrived at my room; I looked up 'MLS Tower' and found it to be an airport in Montana; so I figured the message re: MLS was probably in error. The more I thought about it the next day; I came to realize that during transition from the SUUTR1 Arrival to the visual approach; it is possible that we transited SAC Exec Airport Class D airspace. NorCal cleared us for visual approach to 34L and I turned slightly to the right around ELMAC toward the FAF (HADSU). At about this time; NorCal issued us a traffic advisory. We did not see any traffic where the controller described visually or on TCAS. We were both busy looking for that traffic as I descended toward the FAF altitude; all the while remaining above the 34L glideslope.It is possible; looking at the airspace later; that we may have inadvertently clipped the edge of SAC Exec Airport Class D airspace; which is a five mile ring up to 2;500 feet. I have been flying into SMF for [many] years; and have never noticed how close that airport is to the arrival corridor to 34L and 34R. It is possible with the fairly recent advent of the SUUTR 1 STAR; that we are being brought closer to the Class D airspace than we were previously when we typically were vectored by NorCal. It is also nearly impossible to tell exactly where the five mile boundary of that Class D is when you are flying the arrival/approach unless you happen to see the airport itself; which we did not.If this is indeed what the 'phone call' was about; we should inform company crews of the need to stay on the LNAV arrival all the way to ELMAC and/or be very careful of the SAC Exec Class D airspace.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Over 30 minutes passed and CAR40 had NOT been put into effect. It should have only taken 5 minutes. At the time I had 7 aircraft in my sector and 6 of them deviated into W158A. This is dangerous because I can not see aircraft that the Navy might have flying in there. Basically; I can not ensure separation from a mid-air collision when aircraft under my control fly through the warning airspace. CAR40 procedures are what keep these commercial aircraft safe. They were not used.TMU and local management ignore the concerns of the controller workforce. They should work and listen to us. It is us; the air traffic controller; who are the ones certified on the various sectors. TMU is not even certified in the areas that they work with. This is why it is a continuing problem. Some of them try hard; but if you just don't have the knowledge necessarily you won't be able to help; more times than not they make it worse.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1030,1030,1030,1030,6846,I was pilot not flying. The First Officer; the pilot flying recently completed his first 100 hours in type and is new to the 737. We were cleared for takeoff on Runway 1 via the National 3 SID. On initial climb; the pilot flying failed to maintain adequate course tracking and flew into P-56. Contributing factors included the following. The aircraft was misfueled by almost twice the planned fuel load; 33;000 LBS actual versus 18;000 LBS planned. Pre-takeoff duties thus included conversations with Dispatch and the load agent to ensure aircraft could [legally] depart Runway 1; and then land at an appropriate landing weight at destination. Simply put; we were heavy. Finally; we were mindful more than usual of our departure time due to the presence of a VIP passenger. During takeoff; as the pilot flying rotated the aircraft; he remarked; 'The nose is really heavy.' After liftoff; he appeared to be preoccupied with trimming the aircraft. I stated; 'Get that turn going; crank it over.' He turned left immediately to recapture the course. Once we were established in the turn; ATC asked if we were on course. I replied that we were in the turn and reintercepting. I noted that our track appeared to be west of both fix D341C and GTN; both of which I had input on the fix page during our pre-takeoff briefing for the engine failure procedure. During the climbout I was advised by ATC of a possible violation and provided a phone number to call. Once I arrived at the destination; I called and was advised that we had in fact violated area P-56. In the future; especially at DCA; I will reinforce how important it is to precisely fly the SID. Further; I will be more likely to intervene and take the aircraft if required.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1031,1031,1031,1031,8145,I was given a relief briefing. The briefing included IFR traffic landing at the airports and did NOT include information about Aircraft X. Aircraft X asked for a frequency change. I asked Aircraft X if he was leaving the SFRA. Aircraft X informed me he was in the SFRA and would like a frequency change. I told Aircraft X his frequency changed was approved. I assumed this SFRA aircraft was on his discrete beacon code and he was flying below my radar coverage. I did not observe his call sign or radar track; nor was I aware of where he was in reference to my video map. Around that time another sector tracked up a primary radar target in the SFRA. I was not made aware by the supervisor that there was an aircraft in the SFRA that was a target of interest. I was later informed that Aircraft X did not have his transponder on at all and several security measures were taken including a scramble of fighter planes. In the future; I would recommend taking better action to all SFRA aircraft when they are requesting a frequency change. I would also encourage to have a procedure put in place when an aircraft is on a discrete beacon code and on your frequency for SFRA tracking purposes. This could be something as easy as tagging up the aircraft or putting a 'bat' on this aircraft.

1032,1032,1032,1032,2740,Aircraft X called me as a pop up going VFR. I issued squawk code and within a few sweeps he was inside of Class B airspace. I called ZZZ for the point out. Pilot became disoriented due to low clouds and was getting closer to the Runway XX final at ZZZ. I was able to guide him out of the Class Bravo airspace. At one point the pilot got down to Mode C readout of 200 FT and I issued a low altitude alert fearing that he was just continuing down until the clouds were gone. I got the latest ASOS reading for [nearby airport] and told the pilot that area had better weather at 1;100 FT ceilings. The pilot stated he was in the clouds but could see through the top. I gave him a safe heading range for the climb because he asked for a vector. I asked if he could see the bridge to the right and he said yes I said to follow the bridge then pilot said he wanted to get on top of the clouds and I suggested; based on my knowledge of the area weather patterns to head down the bay toward [the southeast] but the pilot continued NE bound and said he could see the tops. Once on top I had the pilot resume own navigation. I believe that I forgot to say the pilot was RADAR identified; although I observed him squawk the code I assigned and pilot's initial position report was correlated. I do not recall if he gave me the altitude. I was more concerned with getting him away from the ZZZ arrival and safely though the weather he was encountering. I could have told the pilot on initial contact what the latest PIREP for cloud base and tops were at ZZZ1.

1033,1033,1033,1033,10104,Inbound to DEN Runway 35R; we were cleared direct to FRONZ (FAP on the ILS) for the visual approach about 30 miles or so SSW of the field. Captain set 7;000 feet for the altitude at FRONZ. We both pulled up our Class B reference charts for Denver to make sure we would remain in the Class B for the approach. We were descending through about 11;000 feet at the time and it looked like the only altitude that would be a concern on the way to 7;000 feet was the 9;000 feet floor at 20 DME. We made that crossing and headed down to 7;000 feet. Both of us thought that the next shelf had a base of 6;500 feet. We got down to 7;000 feet and we looked pretty low for how far out we were. I looked at the Class B reference chart again and saw we were in a sector with only an 8;000 feet base. The 6;500 feet base was for a tiny sector closer to the airport.The marking on the Jeppeson chart is very misleading. It's showing the altitudes for another sector that the actual text is not in. It has a tiny line drawn up to the small sector which is easy to miss with all of the other lines going every which way on the chart. The actual altitude for the sector we were in is not centered and not easily readable.Redesign the Class B reference page with an easier to read altitude for the small sector south of the airport.

1034,1034,1034,1034,1704,I was working the RADAR position at the Wabash Sector. The traffic volume was heavy but complexity was about average. I accepted the hand off on a GLEX but failed to notice that the GLEX was NON-RVSM per the flight strip notes. The aircraft was filed as a GLEX/Q which is RVSM capable and I did not dig deeper into the flight strip notes to think any differently. I handled the GLEX as an RVSM equipped aircraft until I started the hand off to ZKC. The ZKC receiving sector called my D-Side to ask if the GLEX was RVSM capable at which time we were alerted to the flight strip notes saying that they were not. I then asked the GLEX if he was RVSM capable at which time he said he was not. I then vectored the aircraft to miss FL390 traffic opposite direction. We then asked the aircraft if he could accept FL430 (non-RVSM altitude) at which time they said they could. We then climbed the GLEX to FL430 and switched the aircraft to ZKC.

1035,1035,1035,1035,2177,I was working a combined sector. Weather throughout Center airspace and the Warning Areas had a unique airspace configuration. It started off as a very routine session; but I could feel it building quickly. The oceanic traffic was being offloaded inland. As it was building; we had to do a combat split of the sector; and I don't believe it was recorded. If it was recorded; it wasn't all recorded because we had to get to work. We went from very low green sectors to very high yellow and sometimes red sectors. Most aircraft were deviating. The adjacent Center was giving aircraft routings that took them into the warning areas. This is significant because these are aircraft they work every day; and likely know they are putting them on bad routes. This is technically in compliance with the Letter of Agreement; but completely different routings than they give day after day for normal operations on airplanes filed to the same destinations filing inland. In other words; they should know the correct routings these aircraft should have filed. I asked for a D-side; however one was not immediately available. While all this was happening; the Operations Manager was trying to tell me to ask if a deviating pilot had any injuries on board from a severe turbulence episode he had suffered on a previous frequency. Before you knew it; I had lost the flick. I managed to fight my way back; but as my D-side was plugging in I noticed 3 or 4 aircraft nearing or inside of Warning Area airspace without a point out. I immediately called to coordinate and they said point out approved. I also had one aircraft get into another sector without a hand-off while checking and correcting these routings. The adjacent Center works aircraft on these routings every day that file inland. They should be familiar with these routings. Giving aircraft the first fix outside their airspace; followed by a hard right turn into the warning areas to tie them back into their filed routes coming off the ocean is unacceptable. It significantly and needlessly increased our workload. Also; we did not have the staffing to give us the D-sides that we very much needed at our sectors in order to catch these routes and to deliver the level of service to the user that they deserve. We need more bodies to staff the positions. Since we can't get bodies overnight; our TMU (Traffic Management Unit) needs to be in communication with the adjacent Center TMU in order to ensure the correct routings are being issued.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1036,1036,1036,1036,10050,Aircraft X was in conflict with another aircraft at 36000 feet. I queried the second aircraft if they were able higher altitude to cross; they replied unable 38000 feet but could accept 37000 feet. I then asked Aircraft X if they were able 38000 feet. The response was heavily accented and sounded like 'Able 380.' I asked to confirm; they then said what sounded like 'Standby.' A moment later; I heard what sounded like 'Unable 380.' I then climbed the crossing aircraft to 37000 feet. A couple minutes later; I noticed Aircraft X radar target had changed to a FREE track. I asked what fix they were proceeding to; they replied 'We're heading 280.' I became puzzled as to why and then cleared them to a fix on their route. They made their initial turn in the confines of the previous sector; but I did not notice that maneuver until they were in my airspace.I reviewed the tape and was able to then decipher what they said when I initially asked if they could 'Accept FL380 for crossing traffic;' they replied with '[garbled] heading 280.' I spoke with the Operations Manager to see if a Brasher notification was needed; but he said 'No; we should have caught that.'Readback/hearback is to blame. Heavy foreign accent is contributory. [Recommend] Fast-track Datalink/CPDLC. There is an increasing number of foreign flights operating in US airspace.

1037,1037,1037,1037,6180,I was carrying 6 passengers and one Student Pilot. After using helium balloons to determine wind direction; we planned to travel about 7 miles and land at [a predetermined] field. Shortly after takeoff; the wind speed picked up from 5 mph to 18-24mph between ground level and 3000 feet. The direction had changed as well. With these wind speeds; I was unable to safely land the balloon in our routine flight corridor due to lining up with trees; boulders; streets or power lines on my first couple of landing attempts. At this time; I elected to land in the large fields [near an] airport. These fields were 13-16 miles further east than the originally planned landing sites. After the decision to climb over 3000 feet MSL; I tried to establish radio communication with the airport Tower. My radio did not have a charge. I instructed the Student Pilot to search his cell phone for a phone number to the airport. He tried several phone numbers and could not get a hold of anyone. He was unable to retrieve the 1-800 number for Approach on his cell phone search. My concern was on flying the balloon and navigating my passengers to a safe field to land. I was constantly scanning for a field large enough to deflate the balloon in 18-22mph wind while avoiding power lines; boulders; trees and other objects. We safely landed in a field. I had entered the Class D airspace without radio communication and committed a pilot deviation. I had tried my best to make contact with the Tower but after a few failed attempts on my end my attention was focused on the flying and navigation of the hot air balloon to land my passengers and myself safely.

1038,1038,1038,1038,9764,This is an event between three aircraft; two that are normally in this area and one that is not. All three aircraft were required to be at 11;000 ft. at fixes that are approximately 10 miles apart. DIODE is one of these fixes and is used for BHM arrivals as a route and crossing restriction. WAMPM is a fix on the ZME/ZTL boundary used for crossing restrictions for HSV arrivals. This is a corner of airspace that is shared by ZTL sectors 4/5/12; and ZME Hamilton sector 12. Aircraft X was routed from direct BHM to NULLS BHM which is the preferred routing from the north into BHM. The aircraft was later rerouted DIODE BHM for reasons unknown. This aircraft would not have entered ZTL 04 if was kept on the preferred routing. Aircraft Y departing from PHL to BHM via DIODE BHM. There is an automated information transfer procedure between ZTL06/05 where the 06 controller descends the aircraft to FL240; and Sector 05 puts in an altitude of 11;000 feet or higher traffic permitting and hands the aircraft off to sector 04.  The Sector 05 Controller followed the procedure and entered 11;000 ft. in the data block. At some point; ZME [Sector] 12 pointed Aircraft X to ZTL 05 descending to 11;000 ft. and sector 05 approved the point out. Aircraft Y was still in the upper altitudes and had a faster ground speed but as the aircraft got lower the ground speed bled off and essentially was now tied at DIODE with Aircraft X.I was working Sector 04 and had the hand off on Aircraft Y; and Aircraft X was in hand off status when I recognized the potential conflict. Sector 06 switched the Aircraft Y to my frequency in which I had to stop the aircraft at 15;000 to ensure separation. Further I had to turn the Aircraft X to a 130 heading to sequence the aircraft into BHM in a safe and efficient manner.  Aircraft Z had to be stepped down to 11;000 ft. referenced both BHM inbounds as well. This safety event happened because Aircraft X should have never been put over the DIODE routing as it is not routine and requires coordination with an additional sector with not enough time to make a well thought out plan for separation. After speaking to my colleague at 05 it was stated that once it was realized there was a potential conflict; both aircraft were not on frequency to be able to do anything.  I had gone from never seeing this route and conflict before to twice in one session. The other resulting in a less complex and safe outcome.In the future I would like to have the aircraft on the preferred routing unless otherwise coordinated.

1039,1039,1039,1039,8683,I reviewed the TFR below before departing to APC on a VFR night flight. I made the mistake of incorrectly reading the TFR on my iPhone as I read the first section regarding the 30 NM radius from the SFO VOR. When I got to the end of the lines referring to the 30 NM off SFO there was a blank section of 4 empty lines so I did not realize there was more to the TFR regarding the SAU VOR. I saw that I was 40 NM from SFO and APC was 36NM from SFO. I then felt I would be clear of the TFR so I made the direct flight. Before departing I was able to pick up ASOS while taxing on the ground. ASOS informed me the Tower was closed; the weather conditions were VFR; that there was a TFR in the Bay Area; no mention of Napa being within the TFR. I know it is my responsibility to know before I go; however had I heard that Napa was within the TFR it could have been helpful and I would have called Center on the ground and requested to make the flight. I learned a hard lesson here as I should have contacting Center and requested a code because I was planning a flight so close to the TFR. As an instructor I teach my students to be in communications with ATC whenever possible and I have over 300 hours last year on IFR flights so I am very comfortable with the ATC system.

1040,1040,1040,1040,1707,I am new pilot at this company. When our departure time arrived; I attempted to get an IFR clearance from Departure Control. After making initial contact with them; I received no callback with my clearance after several minutes. Our passengers had arrived and started boarding the aircraft. It was hot outside and inside the aircraft. I went ahead and got the engines started and advised the other pilot (one of our senior captains who was flying as my First Officer) that I was still waiting for our IFR clearance when he arrived on the flight deck after closing the passenger door. He said that he would get the clearance. He then called Departure Control and copied down the clearance and read it back. It was a 'Hold for Release' clearance. I overheard him read back the clearance as I was finishing up some pre-flight checks. We each performed pre-flight checks and duties as we taxied towards the takeoff runway. As we neared the end of the takeoff runway; I asked the other pilot; 'Are we released.' I was feeling uneasy about this as I had not heard us receive an IFR release for takeoff. His reply was 'Yes.' At this point; I questioned my own situational awareness and figured that I had missed a radio call that he had made; perhaps on the other radio; and that if he said we were released then we were released. We taxied out onto the departure runway; took off and followed the clearance of runway heading and a climb to 2000 feet. The other pilot contacted Departure Control immediately after departure. Prior to entering the Class C airspace that is above; radio communication was established with Departure Control by the other pilot. When the other pilot called Departure Control; they said that we had not been released for takeoff. The weather at the time was severe clear and unrestricted visibility. There was also a high volume of VFR traffic in the pattern at the time. There were no known traffic conflicts and there was no conflicting traffic on the TCAS.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1041,1041,1041,1041,3373,I was working a BE55 on the preferential routing at 4000 feet which causes the aircraft's route of flight to enter an area where N90 Catskill RADAR hand offs are often accepted late and close to the boundary.  I was also working several aircraft arriving to satellite airports over a control span of 100 miles and several departing and en route aircraft.  Two aircraft arriving at a satellite field where the final overlaps the BDL Runway 33 departure area were denied point outs by BDL Tower creating subsequent vectoring and coordination.  Multiple voice attempts were made to contact N90 Catskill on two different landlines for hand off calls; but were never answered.  The BE55 was given a vector away from the boundary while the attempts were being made.  When the BE55 had begun the turn to be contained in Y90 airspace; N90 accepted the RADAR hand off.  The BE55 was redirected back on the flight plan and communications were transferred to N90.  While I feel there was the required 1.5NM boundary separation; subsequent actions and coordination prohibited me from directly determining if the 1.5 NM boundary separation was there during the BE55 turning.  Recommendation; this is a common occurrence in this area and is attributed to N90's RADAR coverage in that area.  While Y90 has acquired additional airspace that alleviates this problem somewhat on a HFD..PWL routing; the new airspace did not include additional airspace for the BAF..PWL routing.  Additionally; the common practice lately of combining Y90 WD and OR positions creates a 100 mile scan that includes departures from the main airport of BDL; inbounds to handle initial approach information for BDL; arrival and departure traffic from 3 towered satellite airports; TEC en route traffic and several non-towered airports with instrument approaches.  Two primary suggestions:  (1) Return to the practice of splitting the two positions; and (2) seek to acquire additional airspace along the west side of Y90 airspace in the WD sector that will alleviate the attributed radar problem.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1042,1042,1042,1042,6404,I was the CFII conducting an Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC) with an instrument rated pilot; who was also the owner of the aircraft and was the PIC; per mutual agreement. The PIC; flying the plane; was flying practice instrument approaches; as part of the IPC. The pilot flying was using a view limiting device; I was in the right seat and conducting visual clearance.We departed on an SFRA flight plan; and proceeded north to exit at the WOOLY GATE. At that time; SFRA services terminated and we were directed to Squawk 1200. We proceeded direct the FDK VORTAC; and contacted Potomac TRACON for flight following and a practice approach. We advised Potomac that we desired practice instrument approaches; the FDK VOR-A; own navigation; and ILS 23; with vectors. Potomac advised us to fly the VOR-A practice approach on our own; and then to call after completion of VOR-A. FDK Tower cleared us for VOR-A with full procedure turn. We flew the approach; executed a missed approach 2 NM before reaching the runway (due to traffic in the pattern); and climbed to 3;000. We turned left heading 080; contacted Potomac; and requested ILS 23 FDK practice approach; with vectors. Potomac accepted; adding 'maintain VFR; visual separation services not provided;' which we understood and acknowledged. Potomac commenced vectoring our aircraft to the final approach course; providing three or four vectors to the ILS final. Five or 6 NM northeast of FDK Potomac cleared us (to the best of my recollection) to 'Turn left heading 240; cleared ILS 23 approach' followed by 'Radar contact lost; change to VFR.' The terminology struck me as 'odd;' because I was expecting 'X miles from Y; turn left heading 240; maintain X altitude until established on glideslope; cleared for ILS 23 approach.' The 'Change to VFR' also confused me; as I would have expected 'Squawk VFR; frequency change approved.' It is possible that we missed a call to 'contact Tower;' and we queried the Controller approximately one minute later to verify we hadn't missed the call. Potomac replied 'yes; contact the Tower.' The Potomac Operations Manager reported post-flight that our call for clarification occurred 1.5 minutes after the Controller's directions. We were then 'cleared for the ILS 23 practice approach;' on glideslope (leaving 2;800); and about 5 NM northeast of FDK on the ILS localizer. We immediately contacted FDK Tower (134.2); and reported our position on the localizer; and our intention for a low approach. Tower was busy with several aircraft; including one which was directed to make a right 360 for spacing. I realized that the Tower Controller was busy and missed our call; and began to search for other aircraft which might be approaching from our direction. It was approximately one minute before we could repeat our call to the Tower. He acknowledged our call; and asked our position. We reported that we were 'three miles out on the ILS.' He stated that we had violated Class D airspace. The PIC replied that 'we were just cleared by Potomac for the ILS 23 approach;' and the Tower acknowledged and asked us to confirm that 'Potomac had just cleared us.' We were now at about 1;800 MSL; on the glideslope; at about 3 NM [from the airport]. At this time; I spotted a Piper Seneca; proceeding in the same direction landing Runway 23; about 300 FT below; 300 FT horizontal separation; behind us but flying at a higher airspeed. Had we continued to follow the glideslope inbound; it is possible that we would have impacted the Seneca from above (Note: we received no traffic calls or alerts from TRACON or Tower; we visually located traffic).We executed a missed approach and climbed straight ahead to 3;000; followed by a left turn direct EMI VORTAC and returned to our departure airport.Analysis: I had previously flown practice ILS 23 approaches to FDK; with vectors from Potomac; and had no problems. After discussions with Potomac post flight; we learned that Potomac does notdo 'handoffs' to the contracted Tower at FDK. We believed that; after having being vectored to the final approach course of the ILS and 'cleared for the approach;' that Potomac would notify the Tower of our approach. In retrospect; when we were unable to contact FDK Tower due to frequency congestion; a safer course of action would have been to execute a missed approach and climb to 3;000 (above the Class D). I did not recommend this approach to the PIC because 1) visibility was unrestricted; 2) I have flown hundreds of practice approaches and never NOT been able to contact Tower in time; and 3) Potomac had 'cleared us for the approach;' giving us a sense of security that; in retrospect; was overrated.I recommend that Potomac TRACON establish a more defined and safer procedure for conducting instrument approaches to FDK; or that the FAA inform pilots in the DC area to not expect handoffs from Approach Control to FDK Tower and not allow them to develop a false sense of security.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1043,1043,1043,1043,4992,I was working Sector R8 at ZAN. Fifteen to twenty minutes after taking the sector; an aircraft; enroute  to KTN; called me looking for lower. The aircraft was about fifty miles southeast of my sector boundary and still inside CYVR's airspace. I checked the flight strip and saw that he intended to land in KTN; issued a pilot's discretion descent to 080 and issued the KTN altimeter setting. Several minutes later a CYVR Controller called and asked me if I was talking to the aircraft. I responded that I was and that he was issued a descent to 080. The CYVR Controller said he had 'just sat down' and was confused about the aircraft because he didn't show a descent issued or a hand off made with ZAN. The pilot had switched frequencies without permission from CYVR. Recommendation; ZAN and CYVR share RADAR data in the KTN area but are required to make manual hand off's. When looking at a target on the scope; it appears that ZAN has taken the hand off as soon as the target appears.

1044,1044,1044,1044,726,Aircraft X was inbound on an ILS approach to [Runway] 16R; on short final he unexpectedly went around. Our procedure with a go around on an ILS approach is to do the published missed approach. I called the Valley Sector at SoCal Approach and they concurred. The Local Controller told him to execute the published missed approach and the plane appeared to be doing so. He turned southeast bound and was given the Departure frequency; and the frequency change. Shortly after the Valley Sector yelled on the line that they need to talk to Aircraft X so I said we'll try again and the Controller switched him again. At this point we observed the plane flying through Burbank's Class C at 2;500 MSL; flying northbound towards Whiteman airport and elevated terrain. Valley calls over again and we switch him again; this time the pilot responds to the change but then calls back a second later asking again for the frequency. At this point I tell the Controller to give him 120.4 the Filmore frequency which is the tag he was listed under on the radar scope. I called Filmore to ask if they had him as he was flying at 2;500 FT seemingly into a mountain; they said no; I asked Valley and they did have him. I told them they need to climb him; they did and re-sequenced Aircraft X with traffic. On his next approach he transmitted that he had issues with his flaps; that's why he went around.The published missed approach isn't really helpful; in most cases it makes the situation worse. He flew right into Burbank's airspace and then into Whiteman's airspace barely missing traffic. In most cases aircraft are visual approaches and thus we don't have this problem but there has to be a better missed approach procedure then to turn them into another Tower's airspace.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1045,1045,1045,1045,191,Enroute to pick up passenger noted some turbulence crossing the mountains and into the desert region east bound and a 10 knot head wind; I would categorize the turbulence as mild to moderate with some up drafts and down drafts.  Cruse altitude was 075 VFR. Upon subsequent passenger pick up followed the same track back to the receiving facility; having experienced the turbulence and winds I elected to come back westbound at 10;500 [feet] VFR to cross the highest peaks and then descend to 065 [feet] [feet].  At this altitude there was still some mild turbulence; and was experiencing a tail wind that was fluctuating in wind speed; but nothing abnormal given the prevailing weather; aircraft speed was normal for cruise flight.  After crossing the highest mountain peaks I began a descent; with the AFCS; altitude acquire upper mode engaged for a level off at 065 [feet].  The aircraft nose dipped down and began a normal descent; approximately 2 to 3 minutes into the descent the aircraft nose pitched down dramatically in what I interpreted as a severe down draft or severe gust from the tail wind; forcing the nose of the aircraft down; the speed rapidly increased.  I applied a slight aft cyclic; as I decoupled the AFCS; the aircraft then violently pitched up into at least a 45 to 50 degree nose up attitude; and began a left rolling moment.  Given the similarity to a (fixed wing) approach turn stall; I applied left pedal and followed the rolling moment with cyclic to the left; reduced collective; and rolled the aircraft back to the right; the aircraft recovered wings level in about a 45 degree nose down attitude.  I then gradually applied aft cyclic and increased collective until the aircraft was in level flight; I believe the aircraft went through about 90 degrees of turn.  The only CAD indication at this time was MM EXCEED.  I turned the aircraft back on course westbound; I reviewed the check list for the MM EXCEED Caution Procedures.  No indications of AFCS malfunctions or hydraulic system malfunctions; the controls 'felt' normal.  I and the crew were very rattled (upset); we discussed what happened and I calmed them and told them we were going to land direct to the airport.Once the situation calmed and I completed the EP review I became aware I was now in the Class B upper tier airspace; I immediately made a turn and continued a descent.  I then called ATC and requested a 'Bravo transition;' whereupon I was given a squawk and clearance.  At this time I continued on a slow descent and airspeed toward the ZZZ airport; my consideration was to not make any dramatic or abrupt maneuvers but continue on this flight profile to the airport given the Mast Moment Exceed.  I arranged ground transport for the passenger and crew.  All con notified and passenger with crew transferred to ground transportation.My summation of the causal factor: given the track of the aircraft and a review of the prevailing weather: the aircraft experienced retreating blade stall; set on by High altitude; High heat index; mountain topography wave activity and an abrupt tail wind or down draft forcing the nose down and a rapid increase in airspeed. I recall no rotor speed horn(s); no 'high' torque tone/gong. No VNE 'LIMIT' on the VEMD; gong or associated master caution; the system seemed to be indicating normally but airspeed was changing abruptly in cruise flight; and I was constantly adjusting power to maintain nominal cruise airspeed. Weather was not as forecasted for that region. Topography at the incident is a dramatic drop off into a valley; charted and known as a glider area.

I started 8 west of DET and planned to head south to the Detroit River then northeast up the river. I called DET Tower and asked to transition their Class D airspace. They asked if I was aware of the TFR over Ford Field and I was not. I did get a flight briefing before the flight (and doubled checked it after landing) and did not see a TFR for the football game at Ford Field. It also did not show up on my multifunction display (Avdyne). I tried to visually remain clear of the TFR; but DET Tower called a minute later to inform me that I was in the TFR. The Tower asked me to turn west leave the TFR. I was eastbound and originally turned north which looked (visually) like it would get me out of the TFR quicker. Ford Field and the TFR did not show on my moving map. DET Tower called again and told me that I was still in the TFR. At that point; I continued to turn northwest to leave the TFR.

Although DET tried to warn me to get me out quicker; I didn't need to be talking to anyone when I got into the TFR and never would have even known I was in it.

1047,1047,1047,1047,6790,Upon landing; I was notified by the Tower operators at FFZ that I needed to contact Phoenix Approach Control due to a possible pilot deviation. I immediately parked; shut down the aircraft and contacted Phoenix at the number given by the FFZ Tower. I spoke with Mr. X and explained I had been instructed to call due to a possible pilot deviation. I was told I may have violated a TFR between Phoenix and Scottsdale. As requested; I gave my name; address; contact phone number and pilot certificate number to Mr. X. I explained I was unaware of any TFR in my flight path. I was told that a VIP transport TFR was in place up to 4;100 FT MSL. I had planned that day to just fly around the pattern and do some touch and go landings. However; it was a beautiful day and I decided to venture further than planned. I flew out toward Maricopa; Arizona and then decided to head to Gila Bend. I continued to E63. After landing I decided to head back to FFZ via BXK and then across the valley. I carry a Garmin 695 GPS and took great care to avoid the airspace of GYR and GEU and stay out of the Class B airspace surrounding PHX passing north of the airport without having to contact PHX Approach to transition their airspace. A trip I have made in the past without incident. On my way across the valley I monitored each airports Tower frequencies including PHX Approach. I contacted FFZ Tower after descending below the 4;000 FT floor of the Class B airspace northwest of Falcon Field for landing instructions. Later; Mr. X from Phoenix commented on the very nice job I had done staying out of their Class B airspace as they were tracking me across the valley. Unfortunately; in doing so; I may have caught the edge of the TFR while descending to get under the 4;000 FT floor on the east edge of the TFR. This I discovered after arriving home and looking up the information regarding the restrictions. I should have contacted FSS and been informed for my flight. Even after being airborne and changing my plan; I should have contacted Prescott radio before continuing. I have relied too much on the regular e-mails I receive regarding things like this such as the President's visit only a short time ago. It was a poor choice and; regardless of the late nature of this VIP visit; I should have known better. I do know better. I can assure you this is a mistake I will not repeat. Pre-flight planning and changes in flight plan during flight require more professional behavior than I exhibited that day and the resources are available to avoid situations like this. Since this occurrence; I have reacquainted myself with the FAA web site and its resources; the ADDS (Aviation Digital Data Service) web site; and even called the Prescott FSS about setting up my profile so they'll know who I am by the number I call from.

ZZZ ATIS reported a 4;000 ft. broken layer with what I observed to be about 50% thin layer cloud coverage as I walked out to the airplane for my takeoff. The President of the United States was speaking in Austin and I was in a rush to pick up my passenger before the customary TFR went in effect. I deemed it safe to fly VFR with ATC flight following pickup after airborne.The airplane was equipped with a new Garman 750 system and recent ADS-B installation. I had spent several hours with an experienced pilot in this aircraft on the ZZZ ramp learning the basic operational system and setup for navigation and communication. I had since flown several flights in this aircraft and felt comfortable flying with the Garmin 750 system.On my initial navigation cockpit setup at ZZZ; I placed the Captain's Garman 750 in the Map Navigation mode to Austin. I placed the CoPilot 750 in the TCAS mode to observe traffic. Even though the Houston HUB VOR was notamed OTS; I set it on the Captain's side in case it might be operational and give me DME and radial guidance and I placed the CoPilot's VOR on IAH. This seemed to me to be a prudent and safe set up for the flight. After takeoff from ZZZ I turned westbound and remained under the Class B airspace which requires about 4 miles of flying before you are clear for a direct flight to AUS. When clear of the ZZZ airspace I asked for a frequency change from ZZZ Tower and went to Departure on 123.8. About this time I observed about a 5 mile clear area in the reported broken cloud coverage. I then checked my radial and DME display for my HUB and IAH VORs which neither were giving me a readout. I then looked at my Captain's Garmin 750 display and thought I was westbound clear of the last outer ring of the HOU Class B airspace. I next looked at the CoPilot's Garman 750 display and observed no traffic that would cause a conflict. I then powered up and performed a high rate climb through 10;000 ft. I then proceeded direct to AUS. Being that I was out of HOU Departure airspace; I skipped going to their 126.67 frequency and went to Houston Center on 132.15.I next picked up the AUS ATIS and contacted AUS Approach. They told me that the Presidential TFR had now gone in effect and that airplanes could divert to GTU or ZZZ1. I chose ZZZ1. On the way to ZZZ1; AUS Approach advised me that HOU Approach had called them and wanted me to give them a call about a probable Class B violation.After landing at ZZZ1; I called HOU Approach and talked to [ the Supervisor]. He said that he had just come on duty and was advised about the incident. I told him that I thought I had avoided the Class B airspace but if he said I had violated the airspace I was not going to argue with him. I told him I realized how important Class B airspace was for Air Traffic Control and I take the violation very seriously and would do a self investigation as to where and how 'I screwed up'.After completing my crew duties at ZZZ; I asked the linemen there to please put a power cart on the airplane and I was going to be back shortly to sit in the cockpit. I then went inside to get on a computer to pull up my flight profile on the FlightAware site. Unfortunately the owner of the airplane has that airplane blocked from that capability. I then went back to the airplane; powered up the avionics to the settings I had put in on my original ZZZ to AUS flight.After much pontification and sitting in the aircraft for over an hour and not having the flight profile; I deduced that I may have misread the final Class B ring or had climbed too rapidly and inadvertently violated the Class B airspace. I can not investigate any further until I get a copy of the flight profile. Once again I know the seriousness of Class B airspace violations.I would now like to comment on what I think isa mistake in the FAA shutting down and/or not maintaining the VOR's in the Operational Volume navigation system and the consequential safety concerns which goes to the crux of this report. After my USAF service; I came back home and have flown out of the Houston area for the last [XX] years. When I first flew out of Hobby they had the VOR on the field which made it compatible to fly approaches to the major runways and do VOR checks at various locations on the airport. Some FAA facilities manager then decided to move the VOR to the top of the parking garage at the main Hobby passenger terminal. The HUB VOR was then turned off during the building of the International gate facilities and has not been turned back on since. I have asked HUB Tower and others and have not been given a reasonable answer why it is still shut down.About 2 years ago a private pilot in an older model single engine aircraft got disoriented and could not find the airport and somehow crashed and died trying to land at HUB. It is my belief that if the HUB VOR was operational this would have greatly helped her situational awareness and this accident probably would not have happened.The epicenters of the HOU Class B airspace is based on the radials and DME of the HUB and IAH VORs. I instinctively know that as a guide if I am over 25 DME from HUB and 30 DME from IAH then I am clear of HOU Class B airspace.In the interest of aviation safety can we get the HUB VOR turned back on and both it and the IAH VOR be properly maintained? They are the benchmarks for determining the Class B airspace in HOU.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1049,1049,1049,1049,1993,I was conducting training on the D-side; and Aircraft X appeared in our active list as an overdue aircraft alert. As a BUF departure we called the approach control to verify his status; they said they had nothing on him. We asked our supervisor to investigate further. A while later the supervisor advised us the aircraft was departing. BUF APCH called us for a manual handoff; we looked and found the flight plan had disappeared on Aircraft X. The trainee took down the flight plan information and began entering a 'VP' [shortened flight plan] into the computer. I suggested using the template to enter it; but he did it quickly and the template was not used. He did a field 10 amendment to add the route information. I did not see then that the VP had omitted the departure point in the flight plan. I also must have missed the Unsuccessful Transmission Message (UTM); or it possibly went to the next sector (high side) where the violation occurred. We did not realize the missing departure point had caused the entire flight plan to go unsuccessful to ZBW; and flashed the data block for higher. The high side accepted the handoff; released higher and flashed the Data Block (DB) on to ZBW. Now I saw the handoff fail; I saw the high side reattempt the handoff and it failed again. Meanwhile the sector had become extremely complex and I missed the R-side switching the plane to ZBW; not realizing the handoff was not completed. The high side was also busy and began manual handoff to ZBW; not realizing we had switched the plane. ZBW had no information on the plane. The aircraft entered ZBW at FL290 without a handoff.There were so many factors that compounded to create this error. Although the high side had control of the data block at the time of the airspace violation; I absolutely consider this to have been my fault. If I had insisted on the full entry of the flight plan using the template or a FP message this may not have happened. My primary mistake was not confirming the Flight Plan entry. I should have checked with my R-Side and the high R-side when I saw the handoff failing. The sector was quite complex but I should not have assumed the high side saw the handoff fail. I did discuss with the trainee the importance of FP or template entry of flight plans. I believe the Center he came from this was a correct way they entered flight plans; and we may have a difference in automation that confused the issue.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1052,1052,1052,1052,6984,Aircraft X was cleared into and operating within the CAPE A ATCAA (ATC Assigned Airspace); within a block altitude of surface to FL300. He is supposed to remain within the confines of the airspace at all times. Aircraft Y was a TPA arrival to the north of the CAPE A ATCAA; and had a crossing restriction of ZINGR at 17;000.  I transferred communication of Aircraft Y to F11 (Orlando Approach) in a timely fashion; and continued working.  While attending to other aircraft at the sector; Aircraft X keyed up and stated 'We are finished in the area and would like to cancel services'; or something to that effect.  As my eyes scanned back to where he should be; I immediately noticed that the aircraft was well outside of his assigned airspace; and was now descending directly towards Aircraft Y; who was now descending out of 17;000 feet and into MCO approaches airspace.  I instructed Aircraft X to amend altitude to 17;000 due to traffic; and advised him that he was well outside of the CAPE A ATCAA and to fly heading 180 to try and get him back into the appropriate airspace as quickly as possible.  Within the next target 'hit' or two; Aircraft X's altitude continued to descend thru 17;000; and I told him to stop his descent immediately and advised that there was traffic directly underneath him at 16;000. The targets merged with approximately 200 feet between them. This all happened within the span of 15-20 seconds; with me advising the D-side position to call MCO approach and apprise them of the situation. Aircraft X should never have left his assigned airspace; and did not comply with any altitude clearance given to try and prevent a collision; leading to an extremely unsafe situationThere never would have been an event if Aircraft X had remained within his assigned airspace as cleared.

1053,1053,1053,1053,5522,I was on top of scattered clouds at 5;500 ft. arriving at HAF from the south. Weather reports from the airport all indicated the airport was VFR. As I approached the IF for the approach I had to decide between coordinating a pop up approach with Approach Control or descending through a large opening in the cloud layer and flying up the beach. I chose to remain VFR and fly up the coast due to the fact that it was getting dark and I had no idea how long it would take Approach Control to coordinate an approach. I descended uneventfully below the clouds and proceeded to the airport at between 1;000 and 1;500 ft. over hills that vary from 100 ft. to 300 ft. high. Apparently there is some drone operator who operates off a hill that gets upset when aircraft fly over at low altitude. He called me right after I had landed. He told me he 'I can not enforce this but I am requesting that we not fly over his drone operation'. I never saw a drone and am not sure if he was operating one at the time. Talking to other pilots it appears he calls every pilot he sees fly over at 1;500 ft. or below. I typically fly higher but on days when the ceilings are 1;500 to 2;000 ft. it is unavoidable to fly low.

1054,1054,1054,1054,9891,I was level at 2;500 MSL along ZZZ1 X route northbound under ZZZ Class B airspace. Light haze; light to moderate turbulence and a strong 30 kt crosswind from about 220. I have flown this route several times. ZZZ Controllers kept me out of B airspace which begins at 3;000 MSL as they always do. After crossing XYZ I noticed bright lights of sporting field and thought about a possible TFR. I had ForeFlight running on my iPad but had accidentally disabled TFR layer. I switched on the TFR layer and found that I was in the middle of the airspace. I decided to remain on present heading noting that the sporting event was completely empty due to COVID-19; not wanting to turn out to a large area of inland water; and realizing that I would clear the TFR in less than a minute on heading. ZZZ Controllers with whom I was in constant contact did not advise of TFR nor did they seem to notice that I'd busted the airspace.I should have been more thorough on the flight briefing. Obviously I did not consider possible TFRs in my planning. Originally I had planned on flying around Class B to the west but the winds aloft were quite strong and I realized minutes before departing that I could take the X route and cut 10-15 minutes off my enroute time. Additionally I had passengers aboard whom I thought would (and did) appreciate the scenic view of the X route at night. This caused me to change my route at the last minute. I had flown this route several times so I felt comfortable which led to some degree of complacency and corner cutting in my planning.

1055,1055,1055,1055,10395,This was my first solo flight in my recently acquired aircraft. I had previously been checked out in it by my CFI and have approximately 28 hours dual in it over the past seven months prior to this flight. The aircraft has an Aspen Evolution 1000 PFD as well as steam gauge backups. All of my prior experience has been in Cessna 172 models with only steam gauge instruments as primary instruments. Prior to departure; I listened to the local AWOS at VKX and entered the altimeter/barometric pressure setting into the Aspen unit. Immediately after departure; I checked into Potomac Approach to establish radio contact for my FRZ flight plan. The controller gave me an updated altimeter setting; which I confirmed was entered into the Aspen unit.During the departure phase; I became distracted because the front passenger door was not properly latched; so there was loud wind noise and cold air blowing into the cockpit (the door was closed; but not completely latched). As I was trying to figure out the door issue; Potomac Approach called and reminded me to stay clear of Class Bravo and gave me the altimeter setting again. At that moment; I looked at my Aspen unit and realized that I was ascending into Class Bravo airspace at 1500 MSL. I was momentarily confused; however; because the Aspen was displaying a much higher altitude reading than my steam gauge altimeter; which was indicating a lower altitude. Once I realized the pressure setting in my backup altimeter was incorrect; I immediately descended to a lower altitude. After settling down; it occurred to me that although I rely on the Aspen for airspeed and attitude information; my instrument scan uses the backup altimeter as my primary instrument for altitude. So even though I was vigilant about updating the altimeter setting in the Aspen unit; my failure to ensure the correct setting was entered in the backup altimeter caused me to have an altitude deviation. I had not consciously realized that my scan was split between the Aspen unit and my backup gauges. There were a number of contributing factors that distracted me during this time: (1) this was my first solo flight in the high performance airplane; so I was naturally a bit nervous about the flight; (2) I was flying in a very tight notch carved out of the class bravo airspace in the DC flight restricted zone; so I had little lateral and vertical clearance in which to makeover the aircraft and I was not 100% familiar with local landmarks; (3) the front passenger door in the aircraft was not properly latched; so there was loud wind noise in the cockpit that was distracting me. After landing; I thought about my instrument scan and made a note of how my scan is split between the Aspen unit and steam gauge backups; so I could become aware of exactly what I rely on for each instrument indication. Additionally; the pre-takeoff 'doors and windows locked' checklist item took on new meaning for me (something I previously didn't give much thought to). Going forward; I will ensure both altimeter settings are entered at the same time and that both altimeters are indicating the same altitude prior to takeoff.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1057,1057,1057,1057,974,Aircraft X is departing Santa Monica on the preferential route for San Jose (SJC). The pilot filed FL280 and I gave unrestricted climb to FL280 when he checked in to my sector. The preferential for SJC aircraft is RZS (San Marcus) ROBIE3 arrival to SJC. 99% of aircraft filed this route of the Los Angeles basin departure area are suppressed for auto Hand Off to the next sector unless someone at the sector manually routes the flight plan RZS direct ROBIE and the ROBIE3; or direct ROBIE; ROBIE3 Arrival. I enter a hand off with a keyboard entry on every aircraft I transfer to the next sector; but I have auto hand off set up as a backup. During the session as the Radar Controller at Sector 25; Sector 28 was combined with Sector 25 and a substantial portion of the W airspace was hot: W289S all altitudes; W292W all altitudes and W537 all altitudes. Having this airspace active with oceanic departures; arrivals and overflights significantly raises the complexity of the sector and requires attention to a large amount of airspace on two radar scopes. When aircraft are not auto-hand off inhibited and have been processed with the work around RZS direct ROBIE; or direct ROBIE; the auto-hand off occurs at CEANO intersection; approximately 15 miles from the Sector 25 and the OAKLAND Sector 14 boundary. At CEANO Aircraft X crossed CEANO without a hand off to Oakland 14. At this time I had another aircraft on a vector around restricted airspace; pointed out descending to miss another climbing aircraft and another 10-12 aircraft on frequency. I scanned Aircraft X as it crossed the Oakland 14 boundary without a hand off and I typed the keyboard entry to hand off the data tag to Oakland 14. I called them on the land line to coordinate a hand off but said disregard when I recognized that they had taken radar of the data tag for Aircraft X. I switched communications to Oakland Sector 14 and went on with scanning and watching the remaining aircraft in my sectors.In this situation; traffic volume was just beginning to increase and a D-Side could have been used for about 15-20 minutes to decrease the workload. Sector 28 requires a high volume of manual information transfer on the land line for all of the oceanic traffic inbound and outbound. When traffic is complex with large parts of the oceanic airspace active with Military Operations and unavailable for use; it is better to have either a D-Side at the sector or to open Sector 28 as a de-combined sector. ERAM processing on flight plans needs to be fixed so auto hand off is available on all aircraft without a work-a-round.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1058,1058,1058,1058,8142,This event occurred while testing ERAM (En Route Automation Modernization) on live traffic. The layout of this new system was something I was attempting to familiarize myself with. It had been several months since I was offered an updated refresher course on this system. The day this event occurred was the second day of live testing at my facility to which I had discovered that all my previously saved preference settings for this particular sector had somehow defaulted back to something that I had not saved them as. Air Carrier X; a B737; was on the MOXEE 6 arrival into PDX and was issued the appropriate crossing restriction ('cross VANTZ at and maintain 12000). VANTZ is on the boundary with PDX Approach. At about 25 miles south of VANTZ; I made the computer entry to hand off the aircraft to PDX Approach and apparently didn't notice the response to my computer entry. The response area was cluttered around various other text boxes (a major difference from HOST to ERAM). With ERAM; the hand off status indicator is much different than it was in HOST (when making a hand off to PDX Approach). When I went to ship the aircraft's communications to Approach I had thought the data block reflected that the hand off had been accepted by Approach. I slant zero'd the data block and moved on to the rest of my work. I give the appropriate position relief briefing to the incoming controller. He sits down on position and goes to drop Air Carrier X's data block because it has left our sector boundary (both laterally and vertically-the aircraft must have checked on with Approach as it had continued his decent and Approach had never called back to ask to try switching his communications to them again) with Approach and he is not able to drop it. He then asked me if I am sure I made the hand off to Approach (I said yes) and he says he wasn't able to drop the tag and it wasn't showing that the hand off had even been made. We let the ERAM Area Representative know that this might possibly have something to do with ERAM and he notes it and says he will look into it. Later the ERAM Area Representative pulls me aside and talks to me about this event and tells me that he viewed 'it' and it was in fact that I hadn't made the appropriate hand off and advised me to fill out a report on it. I did remember that in the briefing given before plugging into the live ERAM testing was that the auto hand off feature was broken (and a known issue) with ERAM if you used a temporary altitude instead of a hard altitude on the crossing restrictions. (Although I normally do not rely on the auto hand off feature in HOST) Recommendation; be more diligent in my complete scan of all my data blocks. Not work with ERAM until it is completely fixed and stable.

I was briefed that R2601 was active FL349 and below. When I tried to display this airspace on my scope I could not. The controller on the other sector informed me I could not display it because it was not activated in ERAM (Enroute Automation Modernization). He then went and turned it on in ERAM. Because it was not activated there were no alerts in URET (User Request Evaluation Tool) and the airspace was not being displayed on high altitude scopes. There was also some confusion as my D-side briefed sector 29; 30; 46 opening.

Up until then I was on Flight Following but since the weather was getting bad I decided to head south then east if the weather was looking better. I wasn't on Flight Following since I wasn't sure I could continue and I was using my GPS for the airspaces. The GPS wasn't looking right however; but I didn't think much about it until I was looking at a runway on my left and right. I was split between Dayton and Wright-Patterson and my GPS wasn't showing I was in their airspace; so I knew I was committed at that point and the GPS was not functioning properly. I quickly got the frequency for Columbus Approach and called them and they told me that there may have been a problem and they gave me a phone number to call when I landed.

1062,1062,1062,1062,4141,I was repositioning the aircraft to AVQ. Approximately 30 miles from Marana I started monitoring CTAF in my #2 radio. There was a Cirrus on a similar route as me that I was overtaking. I told Center that unless Tucson Approach had taken my handoff I would cancel IFR so that I could coordinate spacing to Marana with the VFR Cirrus. Center advised me that there was no other traffic observed between me and the Marana airport and frequency change was approved. I slowed down and configured early to keep spacing on final. The aircraft ahead reported over Pinal airpark shortly before I did; I then also reported over Pinal. A voice then came onto CTAF and advised me I had flown through an active military drop zone at Pinal. I apologized and landed normally. I have several concerns about the jump operation at Pinal. 1. I had briefed through DUATS before departure and saw no NOTAM for parachute activity at Pinal. 2. Center did not advise me of any jump activity over Pinal. Center and Approach typically will advise when the jump area over Pinal and other surrounding airports is hot. Absent this; I joined an extended final approach to 12 to allow time to slow and configure for spacing. 3. The aircraft ahead also reported over Pinal. If the jump zone went hot in the less than 3 minutes between CTAF reports with no advisory over Marana CTAF as well as Center and Approach not being aware; a serious conflict could develop. 4.

1064,1064,1064,1064,9286,Controllers were working traffic on the Direct Access Radar Channel (DARC) only En Route Backup Surveillance (EBUS) system so that En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) testing could be accomplished.  Since 'DARC Only' has no flight plan capability; ERAM controllers were entering flight plans into ERAM so that controllers could pass that flight plan information from one controller to the next and from one facility to the next.  ERAM generated flight progress strips for the flights that controllers were using (after verification).  I noticed the limited data block on a flight approaching my airspace from the North.  I guessed it was Aircraft X (I had an ETMS flight plan showing the flight en route from ANE..MKT..OMA); and since I had yet to receive a strip on the aircraft asked the ERAM controller if he had a flight plan on him in the ERAM system.  He said he didn't; and went to the other area to tell its ERAM controller to enter the flight plan information on that flight so that it would generate a flight progress strip.  While that was occurring; the limited data block entered my airspace without a hand off or other coordination.  When the aircraft entered my airspace I forced up the data block onto my display.  After Aircraft X was over 10 miles inside my airspace an automated hand off was initiated on the flight which I accepted.  Recommendation; workload on DARC Only is quite a bit higher for controllers as there is no flight plan capability and all hand offs must be accomplished manually.  Therefore; usage of 'DARC Only' should be minimized.  However; with ERAM testing; 'DARC Only' operations have increased.  ERAM testing should not affect live traffic operations to the extent it has as it degrades safety.  They stopped using/testing ERAM on live traffic; but we now go 'DARC Only' so that they can accomplish ERAM testing.  Using either system affects the safety of the air traffic system.  They need to develop another testing regimen for ERAM that minimizes the use of 'DARC Only' on live traffic.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1065,1065,1065,1065,7729,The issue occurred during my solo cross country flight; my flight plan was to fly at/between 3;500 and 3;000 feet cross the mountains maintaining VFR and return to 3;000/3;500 feet once I got over the mountains [to] avoid airspace; and maintain VFR and stay under the clouds; to avoid terrible turbulence. I had to deviate course some to do this. While on this flight I experienced communications failure with Center and could not get in touch with anyone. Being a student pilot; without communications; and flying into a major airport I considered this to be an emergency situation. As I was crossing over [a] Class D airspace at 3;500 feet I encountered a regional jet that was to my right going south to north as I was going east to west. Without communication and without a way to get in touch or make sure he knew where I was I dropped altitude to avoid the regional jet. While landing there was a crosswind coming across the field.

1066,1066,1066,1066,436,After takeoff we were flying the Cottonwood 2 departure which has a single engine route and once parameters are met you can vacate the departure and go to JESIE intersection.

We had already met the parameters to turn but we missed the turn in a timely manner. We were then asked to contact ATC and tell them why we missed the turn.This departure has you start off by flying a single engine route and then transition to a two engine route. I believe that this is totally opposite of all other SIDs and pilot training. Our aircraft FMS will always load the full single engine route and that is what we should fly in a mountainous area. Between the workload and the design of this SID it lends itself to this mistake by design. ATC advised they had a lot of aircraft doing the exact same thing we did and the aircraft continues on the single engine route and not the two engine turn. Our aircraft is highly automated and this SID does not fit into an automated departure. I feel that a simple ATC instruction by ATC like cleared for takeoff and at 12000 ft cleared to JESIE would solve some of this as well. In my opinion this SID should be revised since ATC is receiving repeated errors of the same kind.

I got airborne and received the fire coordinates from State Forestry and input them into my GPS and started heading to it. I knew I was close to Class C airspace so I contacted approach and they gave me a squawk code. Shortly after they told me to climb from 4500 to 5500 for traffic; which I did immediately. We had also seen traffic ahead on our onboard TCAS display; which was not an immediate threat. We later saw the traffic (UAS) pass below us. We proceeded to the fire and when Approach gave me the clearance for frequency change out of their airspace they told me to call a number for a possible Restricted Area intrusion.

The other aircraft continued on their original track underneath me; and when I looked at the altimeter; I was at 8050 ft; in the class B. I immediately pitched down to regain my original cruising altitude of 7500 ft. My mind was preoccupied to the resolution of the issue when it arose; and while I was taking action; I was not thinking about how close I was approaching to the bravo airspace.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1070,1070,1070,1070,155,3 different 'events' for Special Use Airspace (SUA) all back to back and or adjacent airspace. Aircraft requesting (aircraft X and aircraft Y) SUA have different events with the same start/end times. Aircraft Y has the wrong event number and shows up early. This creates a coordination nightmare to delay the aircraft outside the airspace when it is active with another user. Also; Aircraft Y's wingman called for clearance and exited the airspace late.Using event numbers is cumbersome and creates more work for the controller since they have to be verified on the airspace strip and the flight plan remarks. This requires the controller to have more 'heads down' time or time looking away from the scope. Previously we used call signs for who is requesting to use SUA and that procedure was less of a workload to the controller because he or she didn't have to verify for example that aircraft Y has event ZZZ and that SUA Area is also event ZZZ and that the start time is XA:50 and Aircraft X isn't early. Sounds confusing right? I can provide more examples if need be for reasons why event numbers are more workload intensive for the controller compared to previous procedures.No overlap on events or missions start/end times. I would suggest a 10 minute gap as an example. Create a workgroup with all parties to come up with a safer procedure. Go back to the previous procedure using call signs instead of event numbers until a new procedure is in place since using call signs seems to be safer for the sector.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1072,1072,1072,1072,9193,Aircraft X On BDEGA1 arrival issued instructions for landing runway 28L and to expect ILS runway 28L which requires the pilot to fly CORKK..BRIXX then heading 140.  The pilot instead flew the route as if issued landing runway 28R which is CORKK..FINSH then heading 100.  By flying the wrong route the aircraft entered SUTRO airspace without coordination and placed the aircraft in conflict with departures from the Bay area. I noticed the wrong turn and issued a right turn away from departures.  This happens routinely and is an extremely unsafe situation. The STAR is poorly designed and confusing to the pilots.  Many time we need the aircraft to fly the south route and then land on the right runway.  The two routes after CORKK are labeled as if that is the only runway to land on if you fly those routes and that is incorrect.  There is no standardization in the area for what these landing routes are called. Many call them transitions but they are not listed as transitions on the approach chart.  Management has provided no guidance or proper training on how the routes should be issued.Adding to the complexity of the situation; the sectors are routinely combined.  Because of the numerous problems associated with the other Descend Via route from the south (SERFR1; LAGUNA is required to take handoffs from the center 12 miles from our boundary.  Since the sectors are combined; the sector that provides feeder operations to the final must be worked on a range greater than 54 miles. The constant attention to taking handoffs 12 miles away from the airspace; stopping every SERFR1 and an intermediate altitude because it does not protect from other sectors; Class B and has speeds that are assigned in violation of Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) and monitoring which aircraft fly the wrong way on the BDEGA1; there is going to be a serious event soon.Until the issues of the poorly designed routes are resolved and management can provide proper training for the routes they should be suspended before a serious event.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

As the flight approached the planned top of descent point; ATC directed the flight to 'cross ZZZZZ at 14;000; maintain 280 knots' (arrival has ZZZZZ with a window from 16;000 to FL190); and to advise if we could not make that restriction. We were not given any runway assignment at that time. To expedite the descent; PF used LVL Change; increased airspeed via the MCP to 320 knots and deployed the speed brakes to reach the new descent path; and adjusted the LEGS page accordingly. Once the vertical descent path indicator showed us on profile; VNAV was reengaged and the flight maintained VNAV PATH to ZZZZZ. The flight was never cleared to 'descend via' the arrival; and was not yet given a runway assignment. At this time; the flight began to get three ACARS messages from the crew desk regarding a reassignment on arrival in ZZZ (first one received at XA46Z; second one at XA52Z; third one at XA55Z). Crew noted the reassignment and after the third ACARS message; flight responded via ACARS with 'COPY ALL'; and we redirected our attention to the flight. Approaching ZZZZZ; we received another frequency change; and upon check in with that controller; we were directed to 'descend and maintain 6000 FT; expect Runway XX'. Because we were still maintaining 280 knots as previously cleared; I selected LVL CHG for 6000 FT and we proceeded to brief the approach and complete the descent checklist. As we were doing that; I (as PF) failed to slow the aircraft to 250 knots at 10;000 FT per FAR 91.117. I realized the error passing 8;500 FT and then selected 250 knots in the MCP speed window; and by 8;000 FT we were slowed to 250 knots. The remainder of the approach was conducted without incident; and there was no communications with ATC regarding the speed exceedance. To be clear; while ATC handling was different from the arrival (hard descents and airspeeds; instead of the VNAV profile); all ATC directions were standard and clearly understood. Bottom line is we had numerous distractions in what was a critical phase of flight; and in spite of our best efforts to stay ahead of the aircraft and our expectation for a late runway assignment; I still failed to slow the aircraft to 250 knots at 10;000 FT.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Approximately 30 minutes later; after discussing the day with passengers for a 'pleasure' flight; decided to fly to PVC instead of ACK. Thought process: Having learned that the TFR was of the 'VIP' small variety; not affecting ACK; over flyable at 3;000 FT; with Chatham no longer along the route; thought the TFR to be a non-factor for this flight. En route: with 1200 on the transponder; did NOT obtain flight following. [I] maintained a careful vigil for traffic; appropriate for the perfect VFR weather.

There is currently a NOTAM for PJE 36 miles south of GEG near 33S. At the time he mentioned this that area was at his 11 o'clock and approximately 25 miles. I asked him if he could see parajumpers; and he said he could at about 6;500 feet MSL. I asked the pilot how far away the jumpers were; and got no response. I attempted numerous times to reestablish contact with the pilot; including main and standby transmitters; guard frequency; and also having another aircraft try to relay a message.I had initiated an automated handoff to MWH approach; which was completed. I coordinated verbally to advise that Aircraft X was radar contact lost and also NORDO. About 10 or 15 minutes after I told MWH approach that Aircraft X was NORDO; they called back to say that he contacted them finally. By this time I had dismissed the report as being in the known PJE area.I had no other reports of parachutes while working. When I gave the position to my relief (training team) I advised them about the report; but also told them that my assumption was that he saw jumpers in the NOTAM area. After my break I learned that multiple aircraft were reporting numerous parachutes in a similar area. They were powered parachute gliders. The Controller In charge had tracked down some information about a race of powered parachutes approximately 30 miles southeast of GEG. There were 120 of the powered parachutes; operating from between 12;000 feet MSL to the ground; which is the upper limit of our airspace. MWH was informed of the race; but we were not.Upon learning this; I realized that there were some occasional primary returns south of GEG; but they would show up for typically a very short time and at the time did not appear to be connected. I believe I fell victim to some expectation bias in this situation. In having known parachute activity with a TFR area displayed on my map; it was easy to assume that this is what the pilot was describing to me. Also; if the pilot had been able to answer my questions at the time; this could have been discovered sooner; and we as a facility may have been able to provide a safer environment to some of the aircraft receiving services.I am certain if there had been a NOTAM issued; we would have been able to help aircraft receiving services to avoid the area somehow; through coordination with ZSE at a minimum. The Controller in Charge contacted the guy in charge of the race (getting information from MWH about it); and he told the Controller in Charge that he tried to file something with FSS; but they told him it was too big an area and they couldn't do it.

I replied I was 'Bonanza XYZ.'  He then came back and ask for contact information.  He stated he needed it for a deviation report.   What happened?   I was ready to leave the airport after having some maintenance done on my airplane.  I tried to contact the tower on what should have been the same frequency I used when I arrived (126.25) earlier.  Getting no response from the tower I taxied from the ramp to the runway for a 24R departure.   Here I attempted to contact the tower three times and received no response.   After receiving no response I departed Runway 24R.  I saw no traffic ground or air.  I thought the tower must have been closed.What I believe happened:  I later discovered my number one radio appears to be intermittent. I found it to be cutting in and out when transmitting.  It is possible I thought I was transmitting and no transmission was going out.  Basically radio communications (or lack there of) contributed to this.

However my airport diagrams were on the floor and I did not want to proceed to the airport and make a mistake and choose the wrong runway to land on.   So I stated I wanted to leave the area and I headed southeast toward my home airport until I could get my charts secured and reestablish position.  I was able to retrieve the charts (iPad) quickly and then proceed back to the airport.  I reestablished communications with the tower and was again cleared to 15L where I proceeded to and landed without any problems.

1081,1081,1081,1081,6232,Aircraft X was a helicopter eastbound on an airway. ZSU has a jump zone for paradrops on the airway and on the edge of an enroute sector and an approach sector. The Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA) on the airway is 3;000 feet and off the airway is 3;600 feet inside enroute airspace west of the jump zone. As aircraft X is nearing the eastern boundary of my sector and the western boundary of the approach sector (approximately 8 miles) the Approach Controller calls me for a point out on aircraft Y climbing for paradrops. I advised the controller to hold the jump aircraft because of the helicopter approaching from the west. The helicopter was in hand-off mode. The Approach Controller called me back to advise that aircraft Y was not responding and turn the helicopter north. I had to turn the helicopter 50 degrees north; off the airway to avoid the jump zone; in a MVA of 3;600 feet. I did ask the pilot to maintain terrain and obstruction clearance.Send this to the local safety council for analysis. I could have called the Approach Controller in advance to give them a heads up of the traffic on the airway approaching their sector from the east. I talked to the Approach Controller after the close call and he said the pilot never acknowledged the calls; only calling back to report that they were descending.

1082,1082,1082,1082,5040,I was working D-side at LFD.  OJT being conducted on R-side.  Holding 5 aircraft at MIZAR for DTW and more on the way.  Holding stack started at 120 and extended up to 170.  Parachute operations are common occurrence at Myers-Divers airport; which is about 12 NM north/northeast of MIZAR.  Procedure for para-jumps is spelled out in LOA.  I observed code XZXY; which is one of the predetermined para-jumper codes; climbing out of about 080 near Myers-Divers.  I assumed DTW would keep jumpers well north of MIZAR holding stack; this is also spelled out in LOA; that D21 ATCT will protect for holding pattern airspace while ZOB is holding at inbound fixes.  As I scan a few moments later I observe code XZXY climbing out of 115 very close to holding aircraft.  I called D21 (MIZAR position) and questioned whether para-jumpers were going up; he responded with something like; 'Yeah; looks like it.'  I asked who was working them and called D21 (departures position) and questioned him.  Controller responded in the affirmative.  I was shocked and began to issue traffic to DTW on at least four aircraft in holding pattern and the D21 controller said something to the effect of; 'Do you want to talk to the jumpers?'  I responded; 'No; I don't think they should be jumping right next to holding stack.'  D21: 'They're VFR; you don't have to worry about them anyways.'  I don't believe an official point out ever occurred and code XZXY was above 130 by the time I was communicating with DTW Departures. More conversation transpired; but DTW did not follow procedure and then for DTW to treat this event as no big deal was shocking; especially since about 18 months ago a airliner almost collided with jump plane in same vicinity. If underlying facility is planning on using adjacent airspace they need to provide more notice.

1083,1083,1083,1083,2937,The flight was VFR in the Hudson River corridor. Prior to flight both pilots checked; AOPA and FAA NOTAM's/TFR. Upon reading all of those none outlined TFR's in the VFR corridor. The flight was carried on; and we reached the Hudson. Not until we pasted the George Washington Bridge was it announced that a ball game was going on; and numerous single engine planes were passing through the northern part of the Hudson River. I estimate we where 2.5 -- 3 NM from the stadium; and it is possible that we touched the edge of a TFR. What caused this issue was the fact that stadium and event TFR's are not given as much attention along with not high lighted like other TFR's. On this same day; numerous aircraft where seen passing through the TFR. This is something that needs to be addressed because many people are not seeing this TFR. To prevent this recurrence; I feel that this TFR should be added into the FAA safety training on the VFR corridor because this is something that a lot of people do not know and realize. Also the FAA should publish the TFR and make them easy to find because stadium/event TFR's are treated almost to be non existent. The easiest fix for this is make this a major TFR or make the TFR around this stadium smaller; like 2 to 1 miles in size. This will continue to be an ongoing issue because of the current presentation; and knowledge that people have about the Hudson River VFR corridor.

1086,1086,1086,1086,7371,Aircraft X departed [with] standard routing. The aircraft checked on climbing to 150; 360 heading; 250 kts (all standard). I then climbed the aircraft to FL230. Shortly thereafter; I cleared him 'direct ZZZZZ; resume normal airspeed.' The pilot advised that ZZZZZ was not on his route; that his next filed fix was ZZZ. While that's true; he had filed ZZZ..; The ZZZZZ routing was listed in blue and should have been issued in his original clearance. I advised him to put ZZZZZ in the box and proceed direct and that I had a revision to his routing beyond that; when he was ready to copy. He asked me to spell ZZZZZ for him; which I did. Once he had ZZZZZ in and was proceeding direct; he advised he was ready for the revision. I then cleared him; which he correctly read back. It should be noted that English clearly was not this pilot's first language; making all this communication somewhat laborious.  On high-climbers (FL240 or higher) over ZZZ; [the Center] has an Automated Information Transfer (AIT) procedure within the SOP. The aircraft is flashed to sector XX who then flashes it on to sector XY. I honestly don't remember if I did or I didn't flash the aircraft to anyone; but I don't believe I did. At some point I saw that sector XY had the handoff and shipped the aircraft to them. The aircraft entered sector XX at or very near FL230 without a handoff or pointout. While I like the AIT procedure in general; this may be an example of a problem with it. After a million times using it; you tend to look for sector XY having track control and ship him; regardless of how it got to that point. Also; and again I'm not sure;  I believe I never flashed him to anyone. If that's the case; the data block auto-flashed to XY based on route and requested final altitude; bypassing XX entirely. In my opinion this is unsafe. If there's an AIT it needs to flash as per the AIT; or not at all.

1087,1087,1087,1087,2837,I took over the sector with aircraft deviating on the HUSTN arrival and a procedure worked out with CLT Approach that they would accept aircraft deviating north and they would take care of internal point outs.  After several aircraft made it through the hole Aircraft X said he did not want to work back to the west.  So I asked the following aircraft if they would rather turn back south and join the arrival from the south around the weather.  Several chose this option.  My D-side called CLT Approach to make sure they were ok with this plan.  Their Traffic Management Unit (TMU) (who makes these decisions for the arrival) said it would be ok.  We were told by our TMU to give the 10 Miles In Trail (MIT).  The first aircraft from the south got in and was taken by CLT East Arrival Aircraft Y.  Then we were told CLT was no longer accepting aircraft.  Aircraft Z and Aircraft A were too far into the weather to turn around and got into CLT airspace.  We tried to call many times and neither CLT East Arrival or East Departure would answer the line.  Both aircraft we issued clearances to make U-Turns.  East Arrival never called about the aircraft inside their airspace even though they now had several departures aimed right at him and didn't know what he was doing.  Aircraft A made a slow u turn and eventually East departure took the hand off. There were several times during this weather episode and about an hour earlier in which I was given the instruction to hold CLT aircraft and then I was told they were taking them with MIT.  When we would call the controller they said the arrival was not open.  So aircraft were being issued holding instructions/clearances/and holding again.  Also when they accepted several on trial; our flow told us to work aircraft out of holding stacks which were clear of weather to get them closer to CLT and they would take them one at a time.  This plan of moving aircraft through weather into gaps with the hope that the arrival will soon be open seemed to contribute to an unsafe situation for controllers as well as aircraft.  Also departing aircraft into weather that are going to deviate when we have airplanes airborne holding to get into the airport who will all want to use the same gap increased the complexity of weather deviations as well as creates dangerous situations.  No explanation was ever given as to why CLT wouldn't answer the landlines.    Arrivals need to be shut down when aircraft can't fly the arrival without minor deviations.

The flight was conducted in VFR conditions 6 miles east of the Plymouth Airport (KPYM) and 2-4 miles northwest of the Plymouth Nuclear Power plant over Plymouth Bay and Duxbury Bay. We flew from the airport to a practice area over the water between 3;000 and 4;000 ft. The flight began with simulated IFR training and unusual attitudes. Stalls; slow flight; steep turns; emergency descents and turns around a point were maneuvers conducted after the simulated IFR training.Upon completion of the training flight; I was advised by my FBO the FAA; Cape TRACON (K90); wanted to speak with me. I contacted the person via phone and was asked if I had been operating over the power plant. The person stated the facility's primary radar was out of service and Boston TRACON (A90) tracked my aircraft on radar. A90 subsequently contacted K90 in an effort to determine the aircraft's identity. A US Coast Guard aircraft apparently flew near my aircraft and photographed my call sign relaying it to the FAA.The FAA official I spoke with indicated to me that the FAA wanted me to be aware I was operating over a nuclear power plant. I was operating northwest of the power plant over Plymouth Bay and Duxbury Bay. There was no indication that action would be taken by the FAA in the form of a Pilot Deviation.Since instructing at this FBO for the last 9 years in this area; this is the first inquiry made to me regarding flights in that area. Bordering this practice area is V141; 2.5 miles east of the power plant and FREDO; a holding fix; 2 miles south of the power plant. Also; the area lies near the boundary of K90's and A90's airspace and is approximately 10 miles from the Boston Class B airspace.The wording of FDC 3/1655 'SPECIAL NOTICE' states in part;' PILOTS CONDUCTING FLIGHT OPERATIONS ARE ADVISED TO AVOID THE AIRSPACE ABOVE OR IN PROXIMITY TO ALL NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS. PILOTS SHOULD NOT CIRCLE OR LOITER IN THE VICINITY OF SUCH FACILITIES.' 'Proximity and vicinity' are ambiguous at best. In an effort to resolve any misunderstanding of the applicable NOTAM I recommend the FAA clearly review and redefine restrictions near a nuclear power plant. A pro-active stance in defining 'proximity' and 'vicinity' would remove any subjectivity of their definition. However; the simplest solution would be the creation of Prohibited Airspace around all nuclear power plants and publishing them on all navigation charts.It is unclear at the time of this report if the TSA has been notified and if it would be involved in an investigation.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Fatigue was definitely a factor and it was the end of my week. That being said; when I called my Supervisor over; I noted to him that the auto-hand off function was still active on the data block. At a minimum; this means that even if I'd forgotten Aircraft X; the function should have activated and worked as designed to initiate a hand off to approach when I hadn't done it myself in a timely manner.I'm uncertain; but believe that when I signed in with my settings the hand off that the previous controller had already initiated for Aircraft X ceased.

1091,1091,1091,1091,1950,I was working finals; light traffic as I recall. I had B717 on a right base for 33L into BWI at 030. He was approximately ten miles southeast of the airport and reported the field in sight. I cleared him for the visual to 33L and switched him to the Tower. Meantime; a VFR; SFRA only aircraft on a Z tag was flying underneath the Class B; as they always are; inbound to FME from the east. He was flying under the 1;500 FT shelf; but at one point indicated 1;500. He's 'supposed to be 1;499 or less'; which is ridiculous in itself. The SFRA aircraft then entered the BWI surface area. I also believe while inbound on the visual the B717 pilot descended beneath the Class B. They both end up getting in a close proximity inside the surface area. As they got close; I called the SFRA Controller who said he was issuing traffic. The B717 had a TCAS and climbed. Recommendation; for one; the SFRA position is set up for a Controller to take a lot of heat should something go wrong. The rules are incredibly vague. The aircraft are not receiving flight following. However; if there was a collision; you can bet the first person to be blamed for the pilots not 'seeing and avoiding' like they're supposed to; would be the guy sitting at the scope. For this incident; the SR22 pilot violated the Class B and in a big way. The B717 pilot descended below to the Bravo; putting himself at risk. I was not talking to either aircraft; but had I been working the SFRA position. Not much I would have done differently. The VFR aircraft run the boundaries as close as they can every single day. For them to be permitted to run the very edge of the Bravo airspace by one foot vertically and horizontally is asking for trouble. To then criticize the Controller for not predicting he would bust into the Class B is even more ridiculous. Two pilots did something they weren't supposed to do; thus causing this problem.

1092,1092,1092,1092,8606,I conducted a personal recreational flight in my glider for a duration of approximately 2:20. Almost all of the flight took place on the Sierras crest line NW to SW of Inyokern airport between 6500 and 8500 msl. Near the end of the flight I decided to 'glide off' my remaining altitude by flying ESE bound to the west side or Ridgecrest; make a 180 degree turn and return home into the pattern at Inyokern for landing. While flying a 110 degree heading about 2nm south of Inyokern; I contacted Joshua Approach  133.85 to ask about the status of R2506 (a south extending appendage of the larger R2505 China Lake restricted area). The controller informed me that R2506 was open for use. My expectation was to glide a short distance into R2506 and then turn around returning home. At about a 5nm and 115 degree radial from Inyokern I heard a roar of jet engines and was immediately surprised to see a Fighter type jet pass directly under me (estimated 150 feet) heading southbound at around 250 knots. After this encounter; I inspected my moving map display and noticed that I had actually skimmed slightly into R2505 (0.45 nm for 2.66 nm -- 3 minutes) and had just exited into R2506 at the time of the near mid air. Subsequent analysis also showed that I had come very close to the China Lake NAS Based Class D airspace. The radius of the airspace is 4.5 nm and I had reached into it by 0.25 nm and descended to within 20feet of the 4800msl top. Considerations about the airspace violation: 1) I had assumed that my ESE progress would have cleared the south boundary of R2505 2) My flight display although quite bright; is still difficult to see with sun reflections in the cockpit. Therefore I did not notice the east-west boundary of R2505 on my moving map display 3) The controller at Joshua Approach did not make radar contact probably because I did not have a transponder and my primary target is difficult to discern. Considerations about the near mid air: 1) My unintentional entry into R2505 airspace was not a factor contributing to the near mid air 2) I did not see a PCAS indication from the Fighter transponder on my display (NOTE: system is a non-certificated collision advisory system for gliders used world wide. It also listens for the MODE C; MODE S and ADS-B 1090ES transmissions. Mode C and Mode S targets will give a circle estimated range and warning when close to targets. ADS-B 1090ES targets are tracked and deliver a full FLARM collision advisory). This raises the question as to whether the fighter's transponder was operational. Lessons learned include: 1) Pay closer attention to moving map display indications near restricted airspace. Don't let 'pre-conceived' notions of your location prevail. 2) I probably should have switched to the China Lake CT frequency 120.15 and asked about high speed traffic in the area. During the entire duration of this encounter I was monitoring Inyokern UNICON 122.8.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1093,1093,1093,1093,10069,Moderate to severe precipitation were causing deviations within 50 miles of Boston airport. Arrivals were being rerouted back over KRANN intersection to fly the ROBUC 1 and the 22 L transition on a trial basis as the weather was moving out and they would be able to pick their way through. A few minutes after the first two airplanes were vectored in deviating around weather I was told to go into a hold for Boston. Approximately 4 planes were given holding instructions over PROVI. After doing one turn in holding I was told to run them radar using descend via to runway 15R which was a different runway than the originally had. The first aircraft was Aircraft X and I told him to turn right direct KRANN and descend via the ROBUC 1 15R transition. He would have not been able to make the turn to PROVI to pick up the arrival because it would have been too tight of a turn. He reads it back but tells me a few seconds later that KRANN is past the transition point and he would like to go direct JOODY. At that time I had a few BOS departures and was vectoring others out of the hold and did not have a chance to pull up the Arrival in the URET. I approved his request to go direct JOODY and descend via. I say him leave [at] 110 before he got to PROVI but assumed that BOS approach had that airspace. It was not till minutes later that the CIC (Controller in Charge) informed me that I had an airspace violation with PVD approach because there is not a crossing altitude at JOODY so he descended too early to stay out of their airspace. Because descend via is still rather new and some runways get used a lot more than others it is still confusing as to which transition and fix to go to after deviations or holding. During deviations or coming out of a hold descend via should be cancelled so that as airplanes go off course and ask to vectored back on there is no confusion over what speed and altitude to maintain from either pilot or controller.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1095,1095,1095,1095,608,Busy day at VNY. Runways 34 in use. I waited 15 minutes for a flight following clearance; then about a 5 minute wait in line for takeoff. When I was given a takeoff clearance they voided the entire flight following clearance; and I was issued left traffic. Once in left downwind I was told to proceed to the 'Encino Reservoir' and then 'Griffith Observatory' visually and switch to TRACON frequency. Tower also directed me to a SCT frequency which I may have flipped with the original issued. TRACON said I had the wrong frequency though I'm not sure it wasn't the one the Tower gave me in the air. As well; TRACON said I was in BUR Class C airspace. I have 3 WAAS moving maps in the plane and I was outside. In any event TRACON was not happy. I was not happy. There was just no happiness that afternoon.The eastbound route out of VNY to the south side is psychotic. Unless you have rockets attached to your aircraft you cannot climb above the Class C surrounding Burbank.  VNY Tower restricted me to 2500 feet MSL so there's truly a zero chance of climbing over the BUR Class C. That leaves a very narrow corridor in which to navigate between the Burbank Class C and the Los Angeles Class B until you get on frequency with TRACON. When you get a beautiful weekend VFR day; you just can't break into the TRACON communications in a reasonable time.Tell VNY Tower it's really not nice to void a clearance when an aircraft is rolling for takeoff on the active. I know very well that VNY is an incredibly busy tower. But on this day there were numerous opportunities to depart VFR aircraft just sitting at the side of the runway. My home airport seems to be able to get aircraft out much more efficiently. Usually with a 'line up and wait' directive from the tower. Perhaps VNY is not allowed to do this by some protocol; but it sure would have helped if they could.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

The aircraft was holding nose up pitch trim which I was not aware [of]; or ready for it.

I was taking him on the south side of the airport since we were advertising the visual approach to runway 31. When [Aircraft X] was about 10 west of ABE; I noticed [Aircraft Y] was departing runway 31 on runway heading landing PHL. I heard the departure controller issue the pilot 5;000 feet and a left turn direct PTW. This action put him in conflict with [Aircraft X] and standard VFR separation could not be ensured. This action also violated our local procedures. Departure is not allowed to turn aircraft outside the departure corridor without coordination which he failed to do. Luckily; the required separation existed by the time the targets overlapped. I don't know if the other controller saw the potential conflict when he attempted the look and go operation.

1099,1099,1099,1099,2889,I had just got relieved for a break; and was walking by Sector 3. I overheard the D-Side making what seemed to be a fairly hurried manual hand off to Whidbey Approach Control. I observed that the aircraft was a F18 on a HI-TACAN Approach into NUW. I didn't think too much of it until I was notified a little later that the supervisor at Whidbey Approach called our supervisor and told him we violated their airspace without a hand off. The weather that day was overcast; raining; with many reports of icing. When we get these conditions; because of the seriousness of the icing to the F18's; they want to stay up high as long as possible; then execute a high rate of descent into Whidbey Island Naval base. Because of the high rate of descent into NUW Approach Controls airspace; we must perform an approval request for the HI-TACAN Approach. The approval request was accomplished. The audio and ERAM playback all appeared normal. The Data Block for Aircraft X was flashed to NUW in sufficient time for them to take an automated hand off. The D- Side was taking care of manual coordination; when they all realized the automated hand off had not been accepted. The D-Side then immediately called NUW on the land line and executed a manual hand off. Hearing the recording; it sounded strange as the NUW controller was asking way too many questions about an aircraft that on our scope was flashing normal at them; ie. position; beacon code. By the time the actual manual hand off was accomplished the aircraft was in NUW's airspace. Due to the icing conditions the F18 descended at 15;000+/minute rate of descent. The aircraft's Mode-C indicated FL300; the next Mode-C we got showed FL204; and then FL088; in NUW's airspace. My position is; the reason for the approval request is because of the high rate of descent into their airspace; the approach control must protect for this aircraft in case something were to go wrong with a hand off. We all agreed with that assessment. We then started to investigate why the approach controller did not take the automated hand off as it appeared on RADAR data that he was not even remotely busy. After further investigation; it was found that the ERAM software that we are testing did an uncommanded remove strips of Aircraft X. In a recorded conversation between a ZSE supervisor and the NUW supervisor; the NUW supervisor said that his controller saw the Data Block flash one time then disappear and they got a remove strips. With all of this information; management and I agreed that the controllers on position was not to blame. If ERAM had performed correctly; the hand off would have been accomplished because the NUW controller was looking for the aircraft. NUW did not agree that we had permission to enter their airspace. That is not what we believe; and that is being sorted out now with our airspace office. I was told that this operational deviation would be filed under a systems deviation because of the fact that ERAM removed the flight plan from the system; even though everything appeared normal from our end. I believe that if ERAM would have performed correctly; I would not be filling out this report right now. The causal factor in this deviation was ERAM. The controllers working the position were told they were all good and not to worry about the situation. The next day; I was advised that this would be filed as a systems deviation; with ERAM as the causal factor. Our area operations manager put out a bulletin in our ERAM hot sheet booklet that described the event; and warned  the workforce to be diligent about the hand offs to NUW. The uncommanded remove strips happened again about ten minutes after this incident; and has happened since then. 8 flying the Hi-Tacan approach.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

When the aircraft are on a STAR; it is easier to use fixes as crossing points to slow down after; descend after and depart after. But when aircraft are vectors; then the final CPC has to constantly work to descend and vector aircraft thus that causes more communication and increased workload. Thus if I90 chooses to pack them in; then it becomes sometimes difficult. Nonetheless; I vectored the left downwind Aircraft X to turn to a heading of 290 and join the 27 localizer. I can't remember if I gave him 2000 in the turn. However; when I assured the 2000; there was plenty of distance and time for the aircraft to get down (approx. 20 miles from IAH and in the turn). I noticed the Aircraft X; after some time; that he was still at 4100; so I inquired as to whether he was descending. He mentioned that he was and that I had just gave him the descent clearance. Now the aircraft was about 17 from the airport (straight in) and I turned him to a 250 heading to allow the Final Center CPC room for his aircraft to get down. The Aircraft X decided to chat about the heading; which took up valuable time. I slowed him to 180kts and asked him if he saw the airport or the Aircraft Y ahead of him. I believe at about 2200 he saw the airport so I cleared him for the Visual Approach and told him join at REDOK (FAF). At that time he was about 2.5 behind the Aircraft Y but still about 50kts faster. I told him to slow as much as practical and he said that he was coming through 145kts and then saw Aircraft Y. I re-cleared him to follow Aircraft Y and shipped him to the tower.First and foremost; training has to be done via the SOP. We as receiving controllers don't expect anything negative to come from a poor feed; but as a result it becomes a contributing factor as to more talking and vectoring. The Aircraft X pilot has to be more vigilant when inside the finals box. Asking questions and delaying instruction leads to potential issues. As a result Aircraft X had to go around; thus causing him delays and fuel. I failed to insure his descent to 2000 and his speed behind Aircraft Y. However; (I have not seen the replay; so I reserve my comments) I do believe that there was no loss of separation because of 3 factors; I had Aircraft X going direct REDOK (1000 feet above) and Aircraft Y was already past REDOK; (thus passing behind); before REDOK and joining the final Aircraft X saw Aircraft Y and was told to follow and the tower was using visual rules.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1111,1111,1111,1111,10500,Departed Runway 15R BWI. Familiar with weather as [departure airport]. Rain. Light to Moderate Turbulence on arrival. However; our departure would prove radically different. After a normal and uneventful takeoff; we encountered a layer of clouds at approximately 3;500 MSL. It appeared thin and clear above. The airborne weather radar was operating normally and ON. Also; the tilt function was thoroughly utilized. While passing through this altitude with instruction to climb FL 140 and to proceed direct to SWANN; we encountered what could be described as Severe Turbulence. Additionally; a significant updraft was encountered as well. As control of the aircraft became increasingly difficult; I am unable to estimate accurately our climb rate. My guess though; would 5-6000 FPM. During this encounter; we also experienced a reversal of this climb to level flight or slight descent. The level of turbulence is not something I have frequently encountered.The passengers and Flight Attendants (FA) were briefed prior to departure on the potential for turbulence. They were seated and the sterile light was on. It is safe to say; the amount encountered far exceeded my expectations. The duration of the encounter was 2-4 minutes. My sense of time however was distorted. We exited the conditions at approximately 7;000 MSL. There were no radar returns on our radar. NWS radar showed we were on the back edge of light to Moderate rain only. There was no lightning observed in our area. There were no Convective Sigmets. There were no Sigmets or Airmet for turbulence. There were no PIREPS of such. The winds aloft were not exceptional. I do not know of any Low-level Jet streams in the area. The aircraft was light; approximately 38-39;000 lbs GTOW. The aircraft was configured Flaps 0 by this time (3;500 MSL). Climb thrust was selected. No Cautions or Warnings were generated by the aircraft. No injuries were reported. There were significant speed variations. 240 kts to briefly below 200 kts. Overspeed on the order of 260 knots was achieved in an extreme climb rate.The Stall Protection System (SPS) did not activate. The Pilot Limit Indicator (PLI) did show Green. I do not recall further.Upon landing in; we discussed the matter and wrote the airplane up in accordance with SOP.The aircraft was in severe turbulence. It achieved overspeed in clean configuration and also lost 40 kts of airspeed (my estimate). The aircraft achieved extreme climb rate and slight descent in a short period of time. The relatively low altitude of this encounter was also bothersome.I do not believe myself or the First Officer made any errors. I believe we encountered a very unique area of non-convective turbulence. There were no indicators that this scale of turbulence was present. We did know the weather was marginal and did have reasonable expectations regarding the weather. But to be clear; this event far exceeded those expectations.As the Pilot Flying (PF); I allowed the airplane to climb. It should be noted; I was hand flying the entire time. I did nothing to force the aircraft one way or the other. My recollection is that my inputs were simply to 'steer' the general performance of the airplane. In my opinion; the benefit to this encounter was that it propelled us up; much further than it did down. Hence my technique of 'letting' the airplane do its thing.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1112,1112,1112,1112,8172,When cleared to line up and wait on Runway 01; we were asked if we had the preceding aircraft in sight. We reported that we did; an A-321.  Shortly after the A-321 lifted off; we were cleared for takeoff. Shortly after lifting off and the landing gear was retracted; I began to encounter mild wake turbulence.  This is a very precise RNAV Departure due to restricted airspace. While trying to maintain course and avoid restricted airspace; I kept encountering wake turbulence; in this situation; not completely unusual.  At approximately 600-800 feet; I encountered severe wake turbulence with a rapid right rolling moment. The encounter was so strong as to require full left aileron and some rudder to arrest the rolling moment.  I'm quite certain that we exceeded 30 degrees of right bank. During the recover; I encountered the stick shaker briefly (maybe one second duration) at flaps 1 degree and 197 KIAS.The Pilot Monitoring was very helpful; adding full thrust as I was both hands on the yoke trying to stop the rolling moment. He also made outstanding and appropriate call outs during the event.  In recent history; two of the worst wake turbulence encounters have been behind an A-321.  I understand the problem with the traffic flow into and out of DCA; there needs to be something researched about appropriate minimum spacing behind certain aircraft.  This type of event has serious possible implications.  The FAA needs to do a little research about minimum spacing behind an A-321.  The research has already been done on other aircraft that we frequently encounter there (B-757).,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1114,1114,1114,1114,9480,The Captain was the pilot flying. I was the pilot monitoring. The ATIS for LGA had listed the VOR 4 approach in use for Runway 4. We set up for the VOR 4 LGA and accomplished all applicable checklists to set up for the approach. Outside QATAR; LGA Approach cleared us for the visual approach to Runway 4 and to keep speed up to 180 knots until 5 NM final. Once cleared for the approach; the Captain set up the autopilot (AP)/flight director (FD) to fly the VOR 4 approach. As specified in the QRH; the Captain dialed the altitude to the FAF [NORAY] altitude of 1;700 feet. However; he did this outside of QATAR which was listed as an intermediate fix (IF). QATAR was not published in the FMS nor was the 3;000 foot altitude restriction prior to crossing QATAR. Once he activated the approach on the guidance panel; the airplane started descending below 3;000 feet prior to QATAR. The Captain was concerned that we were getting too low and expressed his intent to level off and possibly climb until we got closer to NORAY. He then attempted to level off but was unsuccessful. He ended up pressing the TOGA button and the airplane started a climb with full power. He then disconnected the autopilot and the autothrottles. At this point; I tried to assist him in trying to re-engage the approach mode so we could get back on profile. We were both task saturated at this point. He was hand flying the plane with no automation and I was trying to help him figure out how to get the airplane back onto profile with the FD. GA/Track was displayed on the FMA. At this point our speed had decreased down to approximately 150-160 knots. Approach called us and said we needed to be at 180 knots until 5 DME. We then increased our speed to comply. The Captain ended up flying a visual approach with the AP and FD off. We had an uneventful landing.Simply put; both the Captain and I were task saturated. Although the Captain was utilizing the flight guidance panel in accordance with QRH procedures for a VOR approach; we thought the airplane was descending too low too early because the altitude restriction of 3;000 feet prior to QATAR was not part of the approach in the FMS. After the TOGA button was pressed we both got behind the airplane and then ATC requested [a] speed restriction of 180 knots [that] was not complied with.I think part of issue was that QATAR was not part of the VOR approach built in the FMS. If it was; then the airplane would have leveled off at 3;000 feet as published on the approach plate. In this scenario; he shouldn't have dialed in the FAF altitude but should have dialed in the 3;000 feet altitude instead. I also think more training on the TOGA button and what it does would be beneficial. We don't really execute go-arounds on the line except on rare occasions so I don't think many pilots are entirely comfortable with it.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I had configured to flaps 10 and gear down before ZZZZZ.  After we crossed ZZZZZ I finished configuring but the plane did not want to slow down after flaps 25; possibly because we hit a gust or went through a shear zone.  I was so distracted by the amount of difficulty I was having getting the plane to slow down so I could call for flaps 30 that I didn't realize we were lowering the flaps to 30 just as we passed through 1;000 feet.The tailwind on final;  ZZZ's request for us to keep our speed up; my relative lack of proficiency and my not paying close enough attention to our altitude were the causes for my error.I will start configuring even earlier when contending with a tailwind on final.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1118,1118,1118,1118,3139,While in line (#18) for takeoff with the Before Takeoff Checklist completed down to final items; we started to hear reports of wind shear on the tower frequency. There may have also been a wind shear advisory on the ATIS. The Captain decided to change the takeoff thrust setting and use TOGA. I asked if he would also like to use Flaps 2. He said yes and I requested Flaps 2 takeoff data from the ACARS. While I was doing this the Captain began reprogramming the Perf page by entering 2 in the Flap setting. When we received the Takeoff data; we had a long discussion about what speeds he wanted for takeoff. He decided to use the Max thrust V-speeds for V1 and Vr and a speed of 142 for rotate. This speed was well below the 154 Vr maximum listed on the data; but he chose it because it matched the 10 knot tailwind Vr for a reduced takeoff (I guess this is his technique). I programmed the speeds into the Perf page and shortly thereafter we departed 4L; rotating at 142 knots. At 800 feet AFE; upon power reduction; the Captain noticed and stated that the flaps were still at position 1 and that we had never set Flaps 2. We discussed what had occurred and compared the speeds we had used with the Flaps 1 data. It appeared that we rotated 4 knots below the rotate speed for Flaps 1 reduced; but I didn't think to compare it to the Vr speed on the TOGA thrust line for the Flaps 1 data.The error was that we did not comply with the flight manual and repeat the Before Takeoff Checklist after repositioning a flight control. Other contributing factors were my flow for setting the new Flap position on the Perf page followed by moving the flap lever to the proper position was interrupted by the Captain selecting position 2 on the Perf page; the extensive discussion on V-speeds; and the first time flying together with this out of domicile Captain.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1119,1119,1119,1119,1129,I was working satellite combined; VFR weather. A BE40 entered my airspace via FAILS; putting him on a modified right base for the ILS 24 at CGF. An EA50 arrived from a 'straight in' position. I don't recall exactly how much faster the BE40 was compared to the EA50; but it was enough to warrant; in my mind; giving the EA50 a vector to the south to build room to put the BE40 in front of him. I accomplished this relatively easily; and I remember thinking that I had been a bit conservative in waiting as long as I did to put the EA50 on the localizer. They were about four miles apart and the BE40 was showing a higher ground speed than the EA50; who was trailing. For the sake of ensuring that my 4 mile interval would remain; I instructed the BE40 to maintain 180 KTS or greater until KROOK; the IAF. The EA50 was instructed to maintain 180 KTS or less. I don't recall exactly what ground speed the BE40 showed as he crossed KROOK; I believe it was around 210 KTS. In any case; within a few seconds his displayed ground speed had dropped to about 160-170. The EA50 was showing an overtake; I think around 30 KTS. I was surprised that a scenario which I had seen countless times before seemed to be developing differently this time. Both aircraft were talking to the CGF Tower; and I mistakenly believed that they could provide visual separation between the two aircraft. I had forgotten that I was required to call CGF and request that they provide visual separation. In any case; I'm not sure I could have effected the coordination before separation was lost. CLE recently changed to FUSION; replacing; or rather; supplementing; our ASR-9. One of the stranger things myself and others have noticed is that it often takes the software a bit of time to accurately display ground speed. A side effect of this is that we often see impossibly large decreases in ground speed. I have observed aircraft showing a ground speed in excess of 400 KTS; only to watch it decrease drastically to less than 300 KTS in a matter of seconds. I believe I felt a false sense of security as I observed the BE40's ground speed; thinking he was much faster than he actually was and possibly waiting too long to assign a speed because he seemed to be going fast enough on his own. I've since tried to be more aware of discrepancies between displayed ground speed; and my expectations based on instructions; winds; and aircraft performance. And of course I brushed up on the LOA with CGF and the application of visual separation. I do feel; however; that the speed issue with FUSION is significant. CLE uses only one long range RADAR; and one ASR-9; plus the ADS-B to generate the fused targets. There seems to be a lot of 'guessing' by the software; resulting in strange phenomena such as PTLs pointing in different directions than the aircraft's apparent line of travel; targets that appear to jump around or wander slightly; and impossibly large decreases in ground speed display. One can tell the difference between three or four 'guess' hits by the FUSION software; followed by one 'real' hit from the ASR-9. I think awareness of these issues will go a long way to helping controllers work around them; but my guess is that until ADS-B becomes much more prevalent; or CLE gets another RADAR feed or two to supplement the two we have now; our FUSED targets may be less reliable than most.

1121,1121,1121,1121,9852,I was training in the tower all positions combined. The workload was moderate with light difficulty. We were advertising ILS Runway 6 due to haze in the area. Aircraft Y checked on and was cleared to land. Then Aircraft X checks on and my trainee cleared him to land. I prompted him to issue a wake turbulence advisory. Aircraft X was 4 miles in trail when he checked on with an 80 KT overtake. I was training so my view of the data tag was not clear as they overlapped. My trainee issued the cautionary advisory. I believed there was a VA in the y scratchpad. The Aircraft Y landed as the Aircraft X was on roughly a 3 mile final. I was scanning the ground traffic; when I looked up and Aircraft X was on a 1/2 mile final and I did not observe the VA in the y scratchpad. We were essentially handed a compression error immediately; and my failure to read the full data tag led to us not taking care of the issue appropriately. By the time I had realized and the phase of flight the Aircraft X was in I felt it safer they land instead of sending them around.I discussed with my trainee we cannot provide visual separation in instances of wake turbulence. He said he had them in sight; however this does not matter. My trainee has 6 years of experience working in a VFR tower so I assumed he knew this rule. He said he observed nothing in the scratchpad but thought he was providing legal separation. In the future I will acquire all necessary data from the tag and pay closer attention to the tag to make sure the separation we are using is legal and take action accordingly. I discussed these 'outs' with my trainee. Call the traffic to the trailing aircraft and have them provide visual; or send them around if a 'VA' is not observed in the scratchpad.

After reaching KORRY; we were told to fly direct to DIALS for the Expressway Visual runway 31 and descend to 4;000. I dialed in 4;000; confirmed it with the captain; and selected Flight Level Change. It wasn't until about 8;000 feet that the captain noticed our airspeed had never been dialed back. To which he called out; 'airspeed'. I grabbed the throttles and thrusted them to idle and he instructed me to pitch up. I clicked off the autopilot and leveled off while he dialed back the airspeed to 250 KTS. To the best of my knowledge; we were at about 300 KTS when he first noticed the discrepancy. Once slowed; we continued the descent and re-engaged the automation. No notice was given by ATC regarding the incident and the rest of the flight continued without issues. In hindsight; what I should have done when given the instruction to descend to 4;000 was to first set the altitude; dial back the speed to 250; and then; once slowed to 250; select flight level change to begin the descent.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1128,1128,1128,1128,4078,DFW Weather MVFR; low layer reported at 900 feet; I was getting arrivals in sight at approximately a 2 mile final. Visibility was excellent below the clouds. Aircraft Y was on final; approximately 10 miles out when I noticed that they were more than 100 knots faster than Aircraft X; but still separated by more than 5 miles (estimated). The Final Monitor Controller initiated coordination with me asking if we (the tower) had the two aircraft in sight and could provide visual separation. I replied that we could not see the second aircraft. Final Monitor took no further action.The Local West (LW) controller and I were discussing the situation when another controller plugged in to Local to relieve the LW controller. LW commented something to the effect 'Oh well; I'll just file a report after July'. It is well known that the LW controller intends to retire. Prior to working LW; the controller had been working Ground West and was engaged in a conversation with the Flight Data West controller and Front Line Manager (FLM). He stated that '184 (referring to the pay cap) and as little responsibility should be all federal employee's goal'.After the LW controller was relieved and went downstairs; I reported the event to the FLM who; I believe; was monitoring the position via wireless headset although he was busy on the computer with something and had another controller at his desk so he may not have been fully aware of what was going on. Also; since he is monitoring the LW position and not the LAW position; he would not have heard the coordination between the final monitor and me.In hindsight I wish that I had directly instructed the LW controller to break out Aircraft Y rather than attempt to influence his actions by asking him if he had it. Sure; D10 could have done a better job; but we had a chance to ensure safety too but we chose to let it go.The LW controller should be referred to Professional Standards and if they are not able to resolve the attitude issue; this controller should be removed from ATC duties until he retires. Training should be developed at DFW and D10 that helps to put the emphasis back on safety and less on efficiency.

1129,1129,1129,1129,9939,This [report is to advise of one of] ever more frequent occurrences on new airport arrivals across the US. ATC is making unrealistic demands for descents and speeds by altering the vertical [navigation constraints] on charted arrivals. These changes are being made with no warning or expect clearances. As per SOP we as pilots are adhering to our 3 to 1 profiles and the expected altitudes on the charts and then with no warning ATC is changing the vertical and/or airspeed constraints with no regard to the ability of the aircraft to complete the task. This event was one such occurrence.While descending on the TWSTD ONE RNAV Arrival into IAH we were given such a [clearance]. It was apparent that the controller was completely unaware that the clearance issued was not possible given the position of the aircraft on the arrival. Outside of MENTL at FL360 we were given a descend and maintain FL240 clearance with which the flying pilot complied by selecting the descent mode of VNAV. The aircraft was below the 3 to 1 path at that time so the aircraft began a 1;000 FPM descent until reaching the desired power off VNAV path and 280 KTS for the assigned arrival. This path was planning to cross MENTL as charted above FL240 while planning to cross the next waypoint constraint; WHACK; at 280 KTS between 17;000 and FL200. The VNAV path was planning to cross WHACK at approximately FL190 within the window and on speed.At approximately FL260 and 26 NM from WHACK the Controller issued a clearance to cross WHACK at 12;000. This clearance came with no prior 'expect' clearance and was just over 7;000 FT below the VNAV path planned crossing. That left us only increased airspeed and flight spoilers in order to increase our descent rate. Immediately we questioned the clearance altitude as well as the planned arrival with the controller and he confirmed both as correct. The flying pilot immediately began an open descent and extended the spoilers to assist in losing altitude. I explained [to ATC] that the issued clearance was outside of the aircraft's capabilities. With the new and unexpected much lower altitude clearance programmed into the FMGC; it was again clear that the Controller had put us in bad position. Using all measures at our disposal we were not going to be able to give the Controller both the altitude and the airspeed. I made the Controller aware of this and explained to him that the planned crossing was much higher than planned by the assigned arrival. He seemed confused as to why it would not work. When I reminded him of the charted altitudes he said that they were not using those altitudes today. I explained that we would need a heads up if that were to be the case in the future. There were no NOTAMS to this effect it was just another controller change to a charted arrival at the last minute. It is obvious that the aircraft would not be able to lose 14;000 FT in 26 NM while maintaining 280 KTS. It was clear that the altitude was most important to the Controller so the Captain used all available tools to make the 12;000 foot crossing although doing so required crossing at a higher airspeed than planned. After [the first controller] stated that they were not using the altitudes on the arrival the next controller issued a 'descend via' clearance! It appears that the controllers need some education on what the aircraft performance limits are and also need to be on the same page with each other. This type of issue has become a problem across our system with the many newer arrivals. The newer arrivals work; for the most part; as they are written and designed but; when the controller alters either altitude and/or speed constraints; it becomes extremely difficult or even--as in this case--impossible to comply.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1130,1130,1130,1130,9130,I was the pilot flying on this Flight We took-off and were flying the departure. We started to clean-up at 3;000 FT AGL and commenced an approximate 60 degree right hand turn for the SID. We were cleared to 6;000 FT as per the SID. I was hand-flying the aircraft during the departure and throttles were being commanded with auto-throttle. About this same time; the plane entered IMC with choppy ride conditions. During the last part of the turn; as we were rolling out; flaps were retracted to zero. It was at this point; as we were climbing to 6;000; in choppy ride conditions; that we encountered a stick shaker warning. I immediately lowered the nose; power was advanced; and the warning ceased. As power was advanced; it was then that we discovered the right engine RPM had rolled back in an apparent compressor stall. As per the checklist; the right thrust lever was immediately retarded to idle as the left thrust lever was advanced to save airspeed. We tried advancing the right thrust lever after a short wait but encountered a secondary compressor stall after moving the thrust lever only a small amount. Once again; the right thrust lever was retarded back to idle. During the troubleshooting process for the compressor stall and then trying to fly a very heavy; performance limited aircraft on a single engine; our altitude varied slightly between 4;800 FT and 5;300 FT on the SID. We subsequently declared an emergency with Departure Control and elected to remain at 5;000 FT for our return for an overweight landing. Approach Control vectored us around for our arrival and ILS approach. We completed our emergency checklists; dumped a slight amount of fuel (with approval from Approach Control) and conducted an ILS approach. During the vectoring for our arrival; we tried advancing the right thrust lever one more time; and this time; power came back normally. We subsequently landed with both engines working normally. Landing and taxi-in were normal and uneventful. Continue to emphasize engine failures/compressor stalls not only immediately after take-off but also in a turn and in the weather during training.

1132,1132,1132,1132,7996,I was the pilot monitoring for the approach. The Captain/pilot flying (PF) had the autopilot and autothrottles engaged and had intercepted the ILS. At approximately 1;500 feet we were visual with the runway so the Captain disengaged the Autopilot; however he was unable to get the Master Warning or Autopilot Disconnect aural siren to stop. He then reconnected the autopilot and unsuccessfully tried again to disconnect the autopilot; however the master Warning and Disconnect Siren would not stop. I also unsuccessfully tried my disconnect switch. At approximately 1;000 AGL; the PF was getting high on the glideslope so I stated to him that he was 'high; fast and the 600 FPM rate of descent was not adequate.'  He did not make any correction nor did he acknowledge me. I then said again; 'Captain; did you hear me!' He stated that he did hear me and then initiated a correction. However; at approximately 600-700 AGL we were still approximately 145 KTS which was approximately 20K above planned approach speed (Vref was 117 + 5K Additive). He stated that he was fast and at 500 feet he intended to go around. At 500 feet we were approximately 15 knots above approach speed......I then called '500 feet; unstable.' He then said 'landing' and continued to land the airplane. It is of my observation that the approach was unstable at 500 feet by approximately 15 KTS fast. A go-around may have been more appropriate than landing the aircraft. However; given the distraction and hindrance to communications between PF and PM from the autopilot Siren; and the fact that there were thunderstorms 7NM off the departure end of the runway; we landed the aircraft.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

No speed brakes were in use. The radar was on and returning no echoes. We flew into an IMC layer and then encountered very heavy rain and moderate turbulence. I reached down to turn on the engine ignition and when I looked up my airspeed indicator was behaving erratically. The excursions quickly grew to any range between MMO and Vls. I disconnected the autopilot; confirmed that the First Officer had reliable airspeed and gave control of the aircraft to him. We engaged autopilot 2. At this point my airspeed tape failed completely.

I do know that whatever the title was; no such wording was available in the QRH or Supplemental manual. This condition lasted roughly 15-30 seconds; I believe.

1138,1138,1138,1138,9074,We may have exceeded the required airspeed at ROCAB on the [MEM] TAMMY RNAV STAR; landing north transition. The Captain was flying and I was the pilot monitoring. Flight arrived from the west. But first; some aircraft autoflight system background. The MD-11's automation [is programmed to achieve exact compliance with airspeed and altitude crossing restraints at waypoints on such arrivals]. However; it ensures altitudes will take precedence. In other words; it will speed up to comply with altitudes if high on profile; thus exchanging altitude for airspeed. This usually happens when arriving from the west; especially in the winter due to the usual strong tailwinds.Memphis ATC tries to move traffic expeditiously. This is great if given enough notice to allow the airplane to meet the requests. Here is what happened. ATC cleared us direct TAMMY and to comply with the STAR thereafter; which we attempted to do. The Captain used speed brakes; to the best of my recollection; for the entire descent until very close to ROCAB where we were given a heading off of the arrival. The Captain had me ask ATC what speed they desired. They stated to comply with the arrival published speeds. We made the altitude restrictions; but I'm not sure of the speed restriction at ROCAB. In fact I don't believe the speed that ATC wanted us to fly was technically the speed we were required to fly; as I believe the clearance for the heading was immediately before ROCAB; which has a 230 KT speed restriction. The speed restriction on the arrival prior to ROCAB is 290 KTS. We were either at 230 KIAS or close to it; I'm sure we were definitely below 250 KIAS. Regardless; what we thought and what ATC thought were two different things. We assumed the Controller wanted 230 KTS; so that was our target speed. That is also why we asked what speed he; the Controller; desired. He never gave us an exact number.Here's what I recommend as the easiest solution to this confusion; clear us for the arrival; let us fly it; and no short cuts. I would not be writing this report if this were the case. Or else; since we are supposed to depart ROCAB on a 067 degree heading. Let us fly that heading. If something else is desired; then change the procedure or use this type of clearance; 'upon reaching ROCAB; depart ROCAB on heading (insert desired ATC heading). This is very clear to all pilots. When given headings at/around clearance limits; it gets confusing.Have the Approach Controller's jumpseat on our aircraft to see how difficult things get when given 'short cuts.' The airplanes I fly are programmed to fly the most efficient and exact flight profile to save the most amount of gas; and as a result; limit noise pollution.Limit the short cuts for east bound traffic--especially in the winter--to at most 10 track NM; as it is very difficult to comply with both altitude and speed constraints when given short cuts. Note that every short cut we get requires the usage of speed brakes to comply with the clearance.Have ATC provide us information; such as 'expect more direct routing;' as soon as possible; preferably when descending while on center frequency. Knowing what sequence we will be allows us to anticipate ATC's intentions of giving us a shortcut. If we know we are leading the pack; then we can quickly program the FMS to start an earlier descent; which isn't the most efficient; but will alleviate a lot of problems.Pilots need to stop accepting clearances blindly; as sometimes we just can't comply with what they're asking us to do. From a CRM point of view; we need to stop trying to 'make it happen.' Note that most pilots I fly with are mission oriented; which is good for the military; but may not be for civilian flying.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1139,1139,1139,1139,9142,I was conducting a stage check for my student and we were practicing engine out approaches.

I took over and attempted to initiate a go around but the aircraft landed on all 3 gear to bounce sharply. I proceeded back to our base and the student and I attempted to get his power off approaches cleaned up and we did multiple touch and goes. After several landings we decided to end the lesson but I noticed that the left brake lost all authority when trying to stop. I took over and prevented a [runway] excursion and tried to slow down in a controlled manner.

1140,1140,1140,1140,7432,NorCal Approach vectored us via the Tipp Toe Visual to 28L in unison with; and slightly behind; A320 for 28R.  We were assigned a speed of 180 knots to 'the bridge' and instructed not to pass the Airbus on the approach. The wind was out of the NE; thus giving us a quartering right tailwind during the approach.  The First Officer (FO); as pilot flying (PF); opted to use no automation; and had been hand flying from about 10;200 feet MSL.  We were fully configured and stabilized well above 1;000 feet and right on glideslope.  All was normal until at about 800 feet AGL; we encountered some momentary wake turbulence that rolled us a little; but passed.  We then re-entered the wake and initiated the go-around.  The PF advanced thrust and pressed TOGA; while attempting to maintain wings level.  Airspeed indications were erratic with the low-speed tape bouncing around and there was a momentary stick shaker activation.  Master Caution began sounding as EICAS displayed 'Windshear Fail; AOA Limit Fail; Stick Shaker Fail.'  With the high workload on the PF; I prompted the verbiage for the profile and we began to clean up the aircraft as we accelerated and began climbing; and full automation was engaged. The missed approach was reported to tower as 'due wake turbulence' and we were issued vectors for a second approach.  We completed the QRH procedures for all EICAS messages and were directed to complete a Flaps Full landing.  I then contacted the Flight Attendants to check on their status as well as the passengers; who were all ok; and then made a public announcement to explain the aircraft upset; go around; and what to expect next.  We re-prepared for the approach and landed without further incident.  After landing; the 3 caution messages cleared and were replaced by 2 cyan messages: 'ADS Probe 4 Fail; ADS Probe 2 Fail.'  Once at the gate; after shutdown; we referenced the QRH for the new messages; which spoke of a ground reset procedure prior to flight.  Rather than completing the procedure I opted to contact Maintenance with the write up.Two Major Lessons stood out from this incident.  First; with such closely spaced parallel approaches; ATC instructions to trail an aircraft that is upwind to us with a crosswind is very hazardous and warrants questioning.  Secondly; knowing when to use automation is as important as being able to hand-fly the aircraft; and due to the high workload and close spacing of the Tipp Toe Visual; automation increases safety significantly by allowing pilots to be more heads up.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1141,1141,1141,1141,696,I departed 1H0 and climbed to 1600 ft MSL which is near the floor of St. Louis' Class B airspace. After passing a 'cake ring'; I climbed to about 2500-3000 ft. When I saw another cake ring appear on the Garmin 530W navigator; I was unable to quickly ascertain the floor of the segment I was in. I quickly descended to about 1100 ft; probably exceeding 250 kts indicated because I was carrying full power in anticipation of a climb; not a descent. I was in a hurry to get down and didn't think of the speed issue until later. I leveled off about 1100 ft MSL and tried to figure out the cake ring altitudes on my tablet; using the Avare app. The tablet lost its GPS signal and locked up. As I was working to figure out the altitude restrictions; I saw some buildings go under my left wing; which made me think I might be over a populated area. And at 1100 MSL; I was only about 640 ft AGL. By then; there were no more buildings in sight; so I continued trying to figure out the altitude restrictions; this time on my Garmin 696 portable GPS. By the time I was able to pan over to the cake rings and decode them; I was clear of Class B airspace. I climbed to 7500 ft and continued to my destination [north bound]. So in summary; I had 3 issues: 1) entering class B airspace without authorization; 2) too fast in Class B airspace; and 3) too low over a populated area. The latter two issues resulted from the first one.Contributing factors: It is difficult to find the altitudes for Class B airspace on a Garmin 530W while hand flying a plane. The backup tablet locked up when it lost its GPS signal. And I had to pan to the rings on the portable GPS to show the needed information.What I plan to do about it: Clearly; I need to do a better job with situational awareness prior to entering high workload conditions; and I will. I learned a valuable lesson about that through this experience. But I also plan to put a PFD and MFD in the plane as soon as possible so the information is displayed right in the panel.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

I returned to the cockpit and advised the Captain that I smelled it and felt that we needed to get on the ground. Prior to leaving the cockpit I called up nearest airports on my MFD and saw that we were within a few minutes of several.The Captain [advised ATC]; and we initiated a descent and turn back to one of the nearby airports which was VMC.

1144,1144,1144,1144,3201,Upon climbing out; we observed an L BLEED EICAS message; followed by an R BLEED message. We noticed the aircraft was not pressurizing so we told ATC we needed to level off at 11000.  The cabin pressure continued to climb so we initiated a descent to 8000. We then received a CABIN ALT warning message as we were descending. When I started the QRH procedure; I noticed that the packs were off and the APU was running with the isolation valve open. In short; I had neglected to perform the after start checklist; even though the captain had called for it. There were several distracting factors during and after the engine start but the failure to complete the checklist was my responsibility. We corrected the settings for the pressurization system and once the aircraft cabin was stable continued to destination. During both our descent down to 8000 and our subsequent climb the aircraft exceeded 250 knots below 10;000 feet. The event was caused by my failure to complete the after start checklist. I had just completed [training] the day before this trip but I was also off work for three weeks prior to my training. I was also distracted by events during and after starting the engines. The wind was gusting up to 40 knots before our departure.  We delayed the engine start until the aircraft was facing into the wind to prevent a hot start; thus changing the normal pace of operations. Also; we had a difficult time finding the tug driver after he disconnected for our wave-off. The wind was blowing excessively hard and I had my mind on the departure rather than my immediate tasks. It was however my responsibility to perform the checklist.  During engine start and immediately afterwards; the FO is extremely busy. He is ensuring that the engines are starting correctly as well as ensuring that the ground personnel are clear of the aircraft. The after start checklist usually occurs right at the same time we are beginning to taxi and my attention is divided between avoiding a wing strike or the location of our ramp personnel and performing the checklists. I need to slow down and be more deliberate while still ensuring that we are not going to damage the aircraft or harm our ramp staff.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1145,1145,1145,1145,1548,We were initially cleared to FL330 by ATC. We requested to level off at FL320 due to winds and ride. We received clearance to maintain FL320 while in the climb at around FL323 and we started the decent by FL325. When we leveled off at FL320; the pilot flying (Captain) selected FL320 on the PROG page in the FMGC; in order to set the mode from CLB to CRZ and re-compute the fuel computations. After entering a new cruise ALT of FL320 vs FL340; the autothrottles pulled back to idle and speed bug unexpectedly dropped to 221 KTS. It did not make sense for the speed to drop this low; which was assumed to be near green dot. The speed selection knob was pulled and spun up; but nothing happened. (Note: It's possible the knob was not pulled sufficiently to force the automation to go from managed to selected mode). Nevertheless; the automation was not doing as expected. Since our airspeed was slowing rapidly; the autopilot/throttles were disengaged in an effort to manually control the unwanted speed reduction. The throttles were advanced into the FLX/MCT detent. Note: There was an estimated delay (8-12 seconds) spooling the engines back up from idle thrust. While interpreting the automation and assessing what is it doing and why; the main focus was on the speed tape. When the thrust started to respond; the aircraft made an unnoticed gradual climb; which was called out by the pilot not flying. Thus; we made an inadvertent altitude deviation of +400 FT before correcting back to our assigned altitude of FL320. ATC did query us but we were already correcting as he called 'check altitude'. The pilot not flying managed to get the speed reset set to 280 KTS-selected mode.

1146,1146,1146,1146,7651,Around FL200; we were told to expedite our climb through FL260 and climb to FL400. We responded no problem as we were in a -700 with only 17 passengers and about 7.5 on the fuel. Out of FL260; I mentioned to the Captain that we were out of FL260. I didn't make any pitch/airspeed adjustments to expedite our climb. I think we were still in VNAV and LNAV. As I was changing approach books and looking down to the right; at FL383; I heard 'Airspeed Low;' and looked at the CDU and saw the message 'Buffet Alert!' I looked at the airspeed and noted it was below 200 KIAS. I looked at the N1s and noted they were at full climb thrust. Either I disconnected the autopilot; or it disconnected. I noticed a very slow descent and then noticed the target Mach displayed at .82. This initially confused me and I mentioned we must be in a severe mountain wave. The Captain said he had spun the speed knob to .82 when he heard the Airspeed Low announcement. I still wasn't sure we weren't in mountain wave; but left the power up and slowly decreased the descent to level flight; and then after considerable time; began to continue the climb to FL400. I think we lost about 300 FT during this episode before we were finally able to continue our climb. I don't recall ever seeing Level Change or anything other than VNAV throughout the climb. Fortunately; we were light and able to reverse the flight path with little altitude loss. I asked to have the FDR downloaded to learn why this incident happened.We could have done a better job monitoring the airspeed in the climb.

1147,1147,1147,1147,6368,An approach to Runway 27L at ORD was being flown with the autopilot on; flaps 22; in visual daylight conditions; I was pilot flying. The winds were steady at first; but during the last part of the approach (inside the marker; fully configured) they suddenly became erratic surging headwind gusts. At about 1;000 AGL; a strong; steady headwind gust was encountered; power was applied to maintain glideslope and airspeed. The pitch limit indicator appeared green; then amber; then momentarily red; setting off the stick shaker for a split second causing the autopilot to disconnect. The remaining approach was flown by hand using judicious pitch trim; and throttle inputs resulting in N1 readings between 74% and idle to try and maintain target airspeed. Target was originally REF+10; but was increased another 10;000 by the Captain after the large gust. The resulting landing was on speed; on profile; and safe.There have been times in the past when I have flown approaches in wind gusts with the autopilot on; although the wind gusts were not very severe. The event in this report contained a wind gust that was just sudden and strong enough to activate the stick shaker and cause the autopilot to disconnect. After experiencing this event; I now know the point where the shaker will activate in wind gusts and will hand fly the airplane before getting into that condition.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

This aircraft's left wing passed very close to our right wing (I would estimate within 5 FT). I have been operating into and out of ATL for over a decade - and I don't think I have ever seen another plane come so close to hitting us. The rate of speed was very concerning as well - I would say at least 15 MPH; maybe even 20 MPH.

Approach instructed us to follow traffic; maintain 180 knots until the marker; and cleared us for a visual approach. At the time we were closing on our traffic and were in the process of gradually slowing to 180 knots. We closed to just outside of three miles on our traffic and then slowed to final approach speed to maintain adequate separation for wake turbulence. As we slowed below 180 knots (outside of the marker) I advised the Tower that we couldn't maintain assigned speed due to our traffic. He stated that slowing was not a problem and that we still had 30 knots of closure on our traffic. Landing was noneventful. During taxi-back Ground Control advised us that Approach would like to talk to us but he didn't believe there was an issue since everything appeared normal. We called and spoke with a Supervisor. I informed him that I was not about to let a Controller put us in a bad spot. We followed his instructions to the letter until we couldn't and then we advised Tower that we had to slow further. Supervisor told me that reduced separation on a (B757) is two and a half miles. I believe it is three miles.

We were at flaps configuration 2; in an open descent and Captain set 2;200 feet; the FAF altitude; and armed the approach. I was watching the radar altimeter fluctuate wildly (normally) as we crossed the mountains east of SNA. It rapidly started approaching 2;000 feet and I was just about to mention it when the 'Terrain; Terrain; Pull up; Pull up' warning sounded. The Captain reacted immediately although not strongly since it was simply not warranted by disconnecting the autopilot and reducing the descent rate. We both saw the terrain and I saw the RA hit 1;600 feet at the closest. I pointed out the airspeed decreasing below the selected airspeed to the Captain (open descent; above selected altitude) and after a few moments of hesitation; he selected Vertical Speed (VS) and put the airplane back into a speed mode and we recovered full situational awareness and both of us were back in the green. During the yellow distractions; the Captain was drifting off heading. I saw this but chose to first; help us get back to the green in regards to the airspeed. Once that was done; the Captain corrected back to the final intercept heading and completed the approach with no further interruptions.

I did notice the 'rumbling' he was talking about and after a very quick scan I noticed that the Captain had not brought the gear up. I said 'the gear' and pointed at the gear. Before we could talk about slowing down to below 200 KTS (we were at exactly 215 KTS) the Captain reached over and brought up the gear.After we had passed 10;000 FT in our climb he asked 'How did we miss that?'

We decided to call center to see if they could give us vectors off airway to a lower altitude since our indicated airspeed was degrading.  ATC gave us a vector off airway and a lower altitude of FL180; to which I started descending immediately to increase airspeed as well as get out of the icing conditions.  This worked; within a few moments we were out of the icing conditions and our airspeed returned.

1157,1157,1157,1157,7465,There were numerous abnormalities prior to takeoff. COVID-19 procedures were in progress. Crew and passengers were required to wear masks. I had a line check scheduled for the ZZZ1 - ZZZ return flight and the Check Airman was deadheading on the ZZZ - ZZZ1 flight. The First Officer had under 100 hours and was assigned to this trip to progress toward consolidation. Upon arrival at the aircraft at the start of the day; I noticed one of the windshield wipers was not parked correctly. It was angled onto the right windscreen. I turned the windshield wipers on; then off to get them to park. The left wiper parked but the right wiper would not turn off. It ran continuously though the wiper switch was selected off. I called maintenance; made a maintenance write-up in the electronic maintenance log; and a mechanic came to address that issue. Just as the mechanic completed his work and the wipers were working properly; I went to the gate Agent to tell her we were ready to begin boarding. She told me that she had just made a gate change announcement. That is when I found out that we were going to switch to another aircraft. I called the Dispatcher and asked if we could keep then first aircraft. The Dispatcher called the system controller and that request was denied. The other crew members and I relocated to the new aircraft. The replacement aircraft had no APU; no external air hooked up; and was heat-soaked. The outside air temperature was in the mid 80s. The temperature inside the aircraft was 100 deg F. The aircraft also needed to be fueled. In addition to the normal workload; I was busy with managing the cabin temperature; requesting fuel; briefing the First Officer on how to do an external air start and cross-bleed start; briefing the ground crew on the abnormal start procedure which would be conducted with the jet bridge attached and the main cabin door open; and making passenger announcements at the gate and in the aircraft to apologize for hot cabin; the delay and to provide an updated arrival time.After over an hour delay; we were pushed back from the gate. We performed a cross-bleed start and a taxi checklist. Then a PITCH FEEL FAULT status message appeared not the CAS stack. I called maintenance and they guided me through a reset procedure that involved pulling 4 circuit breakers; waiting; and then resetting them within 5 seconds to make the aircraft perform an enhanced self-test of the flight spoilers control unit. That procedure cleared the message and we began to taxi. We were assigned a different runway than the one we planned so we completed a full Runway and Performance Change Checklist after updating the FMS and performance data. The rest of the taxi and takeoff were normal. While climbing out of ZZZ airport; we were restricted to 250 kt by the ZZZZZ departure. We were passed from ZZZ departure to ZZZ Center as we passed 10;000 feet on the way to 15;000 feet. I changed radio frequencies; as I was pilot monitoring; and made the 10;000 feet sterile cockpit ending chimes.The Center frequency was congested with the Controller giving instructions to other aircraft. I commented to the FO that 'the hard work was over.' By that; I meant that the numerous abnormalities were behind us and we could now perform a normal flight. Then my attention went to trying to get my radio check in on the center frequency. The autopilot was engaged climbing through 12;000 feet. I wanted to check in on the radio and receive a higher climb clearance before we reached 15;000 feet so the autopilot would not capture 15;000 feet but I was not able to because of frequency congestion. As the autopilot began to capture 15;000 feet; the First Officer changed the speed bug from 250 kt to 290 kt and I acknowledged it. This speed increases is in accordance with our SOP; however; we were still speed restricted by the SID. The aircraft accelerated. I was still listening to the radio with my finger ready on the transmit button. As the speed reached 280 ktI recognized that we should still be at 250 and I told the FO. He began reducing speed and he bugged 250. At that time I was able to check in on the radio and requested normal speed. We were given normal speed by the Controller. The speed was still around 280 and the FO bugged 290 and accelerated to 290. There was about 30 seconds between when our speed exceeded the restriction and when the restriction was lifted. The Controller did not acknowledge that we had exceeded 250. No other outcome arose from the momentary speed excursion. During the debrief; the FO stated that he had heard the controller assign normal speed to another aircraft and thought that we had received the normal speed clearance already. The cause of the event was distraction. I was focused on communication and did not put enough attention on monitoring the PF. Though the acceleration would be normal on any other flight; we were speed restricted by the SID; so it was not appropriate. The FO having low time in the aircraft and at ZZZ may have been a contributing factor. The numerous abnormalities that we experienced prior to takeoff may have been a distraction as well. I was thinking about all the unusual things that happened prior to takeoff and beginning to analyze what we could have done differently. Aviate; navigate; communicate prioritization for the pilot monitoring would mitigate this problem. The last 1;000 feet of climb or descent before a level off is a critical phase of flight and an area of vulnerability. It is appropriate to delay communication with ATC during that part of the flight. There is a desire to make the flight smooth; limit the level-off and thrust changes for passenger comfort. That should not be allowed to create a distraction that can lead to a SID-assigned speed deviation.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1158,1158,1158,1158,7115,During initial flaps 9 climb out my First Officer made a normal 1;000 AGL callout stating 'acceleration altitude'. I replied 'Flaps up; Climb thrust; Low Bank Off; Yaw Damp On' and continued the climb on runway heading per our clearance. Simultaneously; the Tower assigned us a frequency change to contact Departure. I did not visually observe the following: The pilot not flying selected climb thrust; low bank off; yaw damp on. He did not select flaps up. I did not notice this as I was manually flying the aircraft and was watching my PFD; MFD. 9.5 times out of 10 when I am flying I have experienced our 1;000 FT call and subsequent flow being interfered with by a simultaneous call by Tower instructing us to contact Departure. As a pilot you are conflicted with flying the plane first; selecting the proper airplane configuration and replying to Tower's radio call in a timely manner. I feel it was only a matter of time until something such as this flap overspeed event would occur due to simultaneous communication with Tower and crew callouts/flows. Between 5;000 and 7;000 FT I called for FLCH and autopilot ON. The airplane continued to fly normal as I monitored its progress. It was near 10;000 FT that I initially noticed a slight rumble in my seat and in the floor boards. At 10;000 FT I called for the climb checklist; the airplane began its airspeed increase to 270 KIAS as per scheduled in FLCH. The First Officer verbally read the climb checklist. I did not look at the items as he 'verified' them. I then called back to the Flight Attendant to ask him if he heard or felt anything out of the ordinary. He indicated that he also felt the rumble in the floor. I indicated to the First Officer that I thought maybe a gear door wasn't fully closed or maybe a latch on the fueling panel wasn't locked. I didn't suspect anything else as all checklists and flows were completed to my knowledge.We then checked all system pages to see if any avionics doors or other doors were indicating open. We also looked at the gear and they all three indicated up and locked. Flaps and spoilers indications apparently did not make it into my scan. The only abnormal indication I had noticed during the climb was that we weren't climbing as fast as we should have been with our given weight and the slight rumble in the floor. It wasn't until approximately 18;000 FT that the First Officer noticed that the flaps were still at 9 degrees. At this point we raised the flaps and I continued up to our cruising altitude of FL270. I radioed Dispatch and Maintenance to notify them of a flap 9 overspeed at 270 KIAS. We continued the flight without incident and landed normally at our destination. Maintenance met us at the gate and took the aircraft out of service.I wish I could think of a suggestion to avoid a recurrence of event but the best I can come up with is that I will now look in the direction of the switch or lever being manipulated by my co-pilot to verify their action. But in this case; it was an in-action. I truly can attribute this event to low-grade mental fatigue from the previous days' early shows and extensive flying and rote actions of making the same callouts over way-too-many legs in a day along with poorly timed ATC calls with intensive crucial crew actions.As for the possible fatigue factor; I attribute the lack of awareness of the flaps still being extended was due to a pairing that began much too early two days earlier. The pairing began with a pre-dawn show. The subsequent day was also a pre dawn show; with 12:40 on duty and included 8 legs--of which the longest was only 170 NM. All other legs were 24 minutes block or less! Despite getting approximately 11 hours of sleep the night prior to this event; the prior day of 8 legs and 12:40 duty was still a mental and physical drain. I also attribute the possible fatigue to having to wait around in the hotel room until late afternoon on the day of the event to begin the last day of the trip which was going to end very late at night.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1162,1162,1162,1162,4736,Departing ZZZ1 for ZZZ2 I was the PM (Pilot Monitoring) and the CA (Captain) was the PF (Pilot Flying). We planned a low altitude flight due to the shortness of the leg. Some altitudes in the legs page were edited to allow the lower cruise altitude to be selected. The flaps 10 takeoff went as normal (LNAV/VNAV). The PF called for flaps 1 as near as I can recall. I believe this is the case as most if not all of our previous legs had been flaps 5 takeoffs. I was distracted with a radio call or frequency change and I moved the flaps to 1 and did not catch the error. Shortly after that; the FMC changed to the descent phase and the speed bug moved to the flaps 5 maneuver speed; and the A/T (Auto Throttle) mode went from N1 to FMC speed; which resulted in the flaps 5 maneuver speed being the A/T target. As; or just prior to this happening the PF called for flaps up. I moved the flap lever to the up position; and since we were no longer accelerating got a momentary stick shaker. The PF instinctively lowered the nose reducing the AOA (Angle Of Attack). I increased the speed in the MCP window to get the A/T to command acceleration. The remainder of the flight was normal.Suggest crews be alert for unusual mode reversions when using low altitudes for cruise. I would probably use non VNAV takeoff procedures in the future. The big lesson is not new; vigilance absolutely has to be maintained during the 'red' parts of the flight path.

1165,1165,1165,1165,5660,We were given a flight plan with the expected SID by ground handlers at the UUWW with the SID identified as the Badni 01E (WZ01E) from Runway 02 requiring a right turn at 195 KTS and a final altitude of 2;000 FT proceeding to OSTIS Intersection then via WZ01E to Kamenka NDB (WZ). After taxi out to hold short of the active runway we encountered a 48 minute ground delay due to numerous departures before us. In Russia it is all QFE and Meters (no problem as we have been here several times and know the routine) and the Tower will often give you the SID as they clear you on the runway. Since we had a prior clearance with a SID we were not expecting any changes. Especially when the three aircraft before us were issued the identical SID we had inserted into our FMS. Once cleared to take the runway and line up and wait; the Tower announced what sounded to be the WZ01D SID versus the WZ01E SID or so it sounded. Broken English and a heavy Russian accent made it difficult to understand. We ask for a repeat several times and could not clearly understand the SID given. The SID is the same as we had loaded in the FMS only the WZ01E (given in our ground clearance) is a right turn and the WZ01D is a left turn all eventually ending up at the same final point. We then questioned the Tower a few times asking if the Tower wanted us to turn right or left after departure so we could determine the correct feeder route to our final point. The Controller never responded but cleared us to take off. Sitting on a busy active runway with landing traffic behind us we took off with three miles ahead of us before any turn was required in clear weather intending to ask the airborne controller for a turn. We did request a turn from the airborne controller and the Controller eventually gave us a right turn to a heading of 180 (right turn as expected). During the confusion and complications with communications and the language barrier; I allowed the aircraft to climb to 2;650 FT before correcting back to the 2;000 FT on the SID. My speed went to 210 versus the 195 KTS on the SID but within moments of departure the Controller gave us a higher climb; a heading assigned and a speed increase thus we were officially off the SID. No conflict with any traffic and in clear skies; I smoothly recovered the aircraft back to the right airspeed and altitude on the SID almost instantly and no comments were ever made by the Controller. Very sloppy on my part and the lessons learned by this incident is to never depart any airport until very clear on the SID instruction even if it is necessary to get off the runway even after a 48 minute previous delay. Also to use the autopilot after take off to avoid deviations in a busy foreign environment when language is an issue and there is confusion on which way to turn. Since the weather was VFR and visibility greater than ten miles; there was never any loss of visual contact with the ground and no conflicts with other traffic.

1168,1168,1168,1168,1025,I was the First Officer and pilot monitoring on our flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ. This was the last leg of a three-day trip. We taxied out on time and parked to wait out a ground stop. ZZZ was just starting to get the worst of a tropical storm. Convective SIGMETs for embedded thunderstorms covered much of the mid-Atlantic states. The ground stop lifted and we were able to depart 2 hours and 2 minutes after pushback.The first part of the flight went fine; and we were clear of weather until contacting Approach Control. The controller gave us good vectors; but we still had to penetrate some moderate rain showers. Our aircraft was an older 321 with CRT screens and the old radar display; and it was night by this point. This made it difficult to know the intensity until we were very close to the depicted weather. We were able to keep clear of magenta turbulence indications on the display; yet we still encountered moderate to severe turbulence with speed indications +/- 20 kt. below 8;000 ft. Upon turning base; we were in a clear area and could see one more cell crossing the final approach course. Traffic ahead that had just flown through the same cell reported moderate rain and smooth ride. Our ride was worse than that; and after configuring we got an aural predictive windshear warning; 'GO AROUND; WINDSHEAR AHEAD.' We initiated a go-around. The ride was moderate and there were big airspeed fluctuations; but we didn't get a reactive windshear alert. Approach vectored us back for another ILS. The downwind took us around more moderate intensity rain and turbulence. Approach informed us that traffic behind us had landed; and that we were the only one to go around so far. I believe two aircraft landed between our first approach and our second attempt.Our second approach also resulted in a go-around. When we encountered the heaviest part of the rain; airspeed loss was unacceptable and we initiated the go-around. We did not get a predictive windshear alert. I don't recall if we had a reactive windshear warning; but almost instantly we had multiple ECAM warnings and cautions. The autopilot disconnected and Captain assumed manual control - he was pilot-flying throughout the event. The ride felt very similar to how the simulator presents a windshear event. Recovery felt like it took forever. With no autopilot and multiple F/CTRL ECAM messages; we were fully caught up in recovering to a normal state. We climbed up to 3000; which was [the] missed approach altitude. Flight director guidance was fluctuating a lot; and we turned off FD 1 and 2.Re-configuring the aircraft after the approach was delayed; the airspeed trend arrow indicated a very imminent flap over-speed condition. I asked the Captain if he wanted flaps up; and then raised them when he indicated in the affirmative. My perception here was that we were in level flight and accelerating rapidly. In retrospect; I misjudged our energy state and failed to follow the prescribed schedule for flap retraction; retracting them too quickly. As the flaps were retracting; we were somewhere around 3;100 ft. correcting for 3;000; in moderate turbulence. These factors all compounded; resulting in a low-energy state and stall warning indication. I'm not sure what the auto thrust was commanding at this point; or if it had reduced thrust for us to descend back to 3000. I believe I yelled; 'Nose down!' and Captain responded that he was full forward stick. I momentarily pushed my flight stick forward and was corrected by the aural 'dual input' alert. Captain recovered the aircraft. I gave ATC a quick description of our flight control computer problems and they climbed us to 5000 on vectors. We began the process of going through the ECAM malfunctions; with me working the ECAM. The autopilot was inoperative for the rest of the flight. F/CTRL ALTN LAW was next. There is no follow-up for this. I believe the next was F/CTRL ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT and F/CTRL ELAC 2 PITCH FAULT. I know that's the checklist I went to; but after the fact I can't say whether it was the ELAC PITCH FAULT or a generic ELAC FAULT. The pitch fault follow-up prohibits resetting an ELAC in flight; and so we did not attempt a computer reset. The ELAC FAULT reset procedure does allow a reset in flight if you do it one at a time and there are no uncommanded maneuvers happening.After follow-ups; I called Dispatch to see if we could go to ZZZ2 or ZZZ3 or ZZZ4. We had around 12;000 lb. of fuel. ZZZ4 appeared to have storm cells at the field but ZZZ2 and ZZZ3 were clear. I expressed that we were hand-flying with degraded flight controls and needed a clear airport. Dispatch gave us a minimum fuel of 8.0 to go to ZZZ4 if we could not get into ZZZ. Ultimately; ZZZ updated us that winds were shifting straight out of the north; and they could turn the airport around for us. The non-normal section of the Land App confirmed we had enough runway landing distance. The final for XXR was clear of storms; and we were able to shoot the ILS and land.So many factors were at play here. At the time we entered ZZZ airspace we had been on duty for 10 hours. We were navigating around severe weather in a tropical storm with the old-style radar. It was working well; but overall; it just doesn't provide the clarity that the new radar presents. We were in continuous turbulence of varying intensities; occasionally severe; before our first approach. Our picture of what the weather was doing was not as clear as the situational awareness that can be achieved in cruise flight. We were relying on ATC vectors through areas that other aircraft had just previously flown. Reports from other aircraft indicated acceptable conditions; or conditions that we could plan for by following severe weather avoidance guidance. The predictive windshear system did its job the first time and we had a clean go-around. Other aircraft landed after our missed approach and conditions were ok. Startle factor played a huge role on the second attempt. Windshear plus multiple ECAMs and autopilot failure created a complex and dynamic situation. We were getting bounced all over the place. We were struggling to get the airplane under control. The monitoring challenge was huge because of the turbulence and the degraded flight controls. I was making FCU inputs in between running checklist items. I had sent an ACARS to Dispatch asking where we should go and listing our system failures; and got no response. The crew phone app worked well enough; but I was frustrated that the feedback we got was that it would be preferred that we hold for ZZZ or go to our listed alternate. I'm sure the Dispatcher could hear my frustration. I am glad that we were able to safely continue to ZZZ; but I wanted to get the plane on the ground without dealing with any more threats to the flight. Holding between thunderstorms with no autopilot in alternate law is an unnecessary risk. I'm not sure why the ground stop for ZZZ was lifted. After the flight; we learned that there had been 7 confirmed tornadoes in the area right around ZZZ. These storms were moving very quickly. It looked like it was possible that ZZZ would clear up before we got there; but there was a good chance it would not. Our decision to go was based on having a lot of fuel; and two alternates. Our second alternate was ZZZ3; which remained clear. This meant that if at any point the path ahead looked bad; we could turn around and have an escape plan. The weather moving in from the south across the final ended up being the worst that we would encounter. If we had delayed this flight by another hour; I think we would have been better off.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Wondering about the reason; I glanced at his PFD (Primary Flight Display) and noticed an abnormal airspeed indication. After determining that the approach was still stable and on target; I informed the Captain that my indications are normal and I am ready and able to continue the approach. At that point the Captain transferred the controls to me; I accepted and continued the approach to an uneventful landing.

1172,1172,1172,1172,4461,Returned to [departure airport] as a result of passenger disturbance. Evaluated climb limit weight; runway length limit and elected to land overweight. Declared emergency with ATC. Notified company; requested police and medical. Completed normal and overweight checklists. Elected to land on longest runway. I was PM; FO was PF. Ref speed was rather high on final due to overweight condition. On approach in VMC FO was slightly high on glideslope and slightly fast. In an effort to reduce altitude and airspeed autopilot and auto throttles were disconnected. I was unaware of this. Speed brakes deployed. Speed rapidly decayed; and stick shaker activated. I pushed up the throttles as FO retracted the speed brake. Stick shaker stopped; remainder of approach was stable. I failed to observe the rapidly decaying airspeed due to a minor distraction from ATC.Suggestions: Never a reason to disconnect [autoflight resources]; which if engaged provides protection against low speed excursions. A greater degree of monitoring by PM must occur. Avoid distractions; particularly during an overweight landing. Contributing factor on my behalf was that having VMC with runway in sight; and the situation very much under control lulled me into monitoring at a lower level than I otherwise would have.

1173,1173,1173,1173,4604,Flying into PWK near the EDAKE fix. We were at 3000 ft MSL; and ATC cleared us direct HIGUH; RNAV Rwy 16 IAF; and told us to hold 210 KIAS until HIGUH. We were 6 NM from the outer shelf of Class B airspace where the bottom was 3600 ft MSL. I told him I could give him 210 KIAS for 6 more miles but then I had to slow down for Class B airspace. He replied 'I own the Class B airspace!' I kindly responded; 'Sir; I mean no disrespect; but that's a rule you can't waive. The best I can do is 200 KIAS.' Shortly after that a different controller took over and told us to maintain 180 KIAS or better to HIGUH. The rest of the flight was uneventful. This is the third report I've submitted on this subject; but probably the fifth or sixth time it's happened to me. FAR 91.117 (c) has been around for a long time (as long as I've been flying). It's not like it's something new. Are approach controllers not properly trained on this regulation; or are they intentionally ignoring it when it helps their separation/spacing? Every time I've informed a controller that I couldn't comply with this type of clearance they reacted in an arrogant; condescending manner.

1174,1174,1174,1174,4297,I conducted the RNAV 26 approach under IFR; I was not under a view limiting device since I was single pilot. A stiff crosswind; which moved around from 180 to 210 at 10 plus KTS; was present. Ceiling was well above the day's flight altitude and not a factor. During the approach; more than once I encountered light to moderate turbulence. At one point; a few miles out; I lost a decent amount of airspeed; roughly 20 KTS. I was able to recover from that; but it was an indicator of things to come. On short final; I was holding substantial crosswind corrections in order to maintain centerline. In the flare; I experienced this speed loss again -- possibly windshear -- and struggled to maintain control. Given that I was flaring; I deemed it best to simply let it come down; a go-around didn't seem to be an option; and I still believe this to be true. Adding significant amounts of power would have exacerbated the problem. As it came down; the nose became pointed to the left of centerline; and dropped substantially. I believe my failing to pull back on the yoke caused me to 'wheelbarrow' which I was able to fix; but by this point; my momentum was carrying me towards the intersection of Taxiway B. I felt that using rudder to turn at that speed back towards the centerline would have been catastrophic; so I continued. I applied back pressure and full brakes (causing the tires to squeal); but was unable to completely stop before going off the edge of the runway. After exiting the runway into the grass/gravel; I stopped movement and assessed the situation. Tower asked if I needed assistance; I reported I did not. The engine was running still; indicating a minor to no prop strike; the tires/wheels were functioning properly and still inflated; and I was not going to be flying again; so I taxied back towards B; and rejoined the taxiway centerline. I performed my after landing checklist (flaps up; lights off) at this time. Listening to communications; I overheard the airport operations vehicle; which had been sent to check the facility; note that no damage had occurred and no FOD had been left behind. I returned the aircraft to the FBO. A walk around inspection showed no damage -- the propeller showed no indication of a strike; the tires were still airworthy but with slightly visible flat spots; and there were no paint chips/scratches/etc to speak of. I also recall remembering during the incident the FBO's tire bald spot policy. This should not have been my focus at the time; though I feel it is worth mentioning as; when things are going wrong; how much it is going to cost to fix should not be crossing the pilot's mind. Finally; as a relatively new pilot (2 plus years; 180 hours); who'd been sheltered from things like windshear; I now believe I should have reported it during the approach. Whether the pilot of the aircraft which preceded me on the approach encountered these conditions I don't know; as they didn't report any unusual phenomenon either.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1175,1175,1175,1175,6469,During approach to the runway we went down to minimums and began to execute a missed approach. I disconnected the autopilot and advanced the power to climb and called for go-around thrust flaps 8. The positive rate gear up call was missed; but I believe I called for speed mode and nav mode as briefed with the First Officer beforehand. The First Officer became busy on the radios and flying the airplane became a secondary thing. Our speed accelerated as I pitched down to maintain 3;000 ft. as assigned. However the flaps were still extended and I reduced the power quickly to avoid over speeding the flaps. As that occurred I lost situational awareness and began to get spatially disoriented as I checked to see what was going on. In doing so we banked into a 30 degree bank to the left and began to lose altitude. Our airspeed quickly increased to 280 kts. and we got a 'sink rate; pull up' aural alerter. I recovered the airplane from a bad situation and was then able to clean up and get the airplane back into a stable stage in flight.I believe pushing the limits of my abilities in a new aircraft to me was a contributing factor. Although the First Officer and myself were legal to fly together; and the weather was legal for us to Dispatch; I believe our lack of experience and abilities were a contributing factor. This was also my 5th day of duty. Although I felt rested physically; I believe mental fatigue played a role.Although the First Officer and I had briefed the missed approach procedure and call outs; it still wasn't enough. I need to slow things down and make sure that both of us are doing our jobs. I also believe I need to speak up if I feel uncomfortable about a situation. The First Officer said he hadn't flown in nearly 3 weeks and I was new to the airplane. There were enough caution bells going off before leaving  however I felt pressured to go.

1176,1176,1176,1176,6779,At 1000 ft AGL; the Captain lost situational awareness and stopped climbing. I asked if he wanted VNAV two times and after not getting a response I focused on the fact that he wasn't climbing and was actually beginning a descent and accelerating the airplane. We received a 'Don't Sink' GPWS warning. Captain then made an abrupt pull up (2 Gs) while calling for flaps to zero. I saw the airspeed go to 192 kts during the abrupt pull up. I was pushing forward on the yoke to ensure we didn't stall. Captain finally recovered with a pushover of of 0.3 Gs. Flight continued.  There was no interference from ATC. We had been cleared to around 17000 shortly after takeoff (I don't remember the exact altitude but it was not a low altitude level off altitude). After climbing to cruise altitude a discussion was made about the events. Captain thought the speed with flaps 1 was only 260. I saw higher (around 280) but I couldn't say exactly what the speed was. Captain wrote the flap overspeed up as 260 and a visual inspection was conducted in [destination]. Captain stated he was distracted by a 'map shift' on takeoff and he saw a 'Stab Trim' EICAS message at some point. Additional factor is the cockpit noise that prevents crew members from communicating effectively. The use of an intercom system (locking Push-to-talk switch or rubber band to hold down the switch or just have crew members push the intercom switch when talking) would have reduced any confusion as to what was being said/communicated. Crew members have to SHOUT to be heard because they wear ANR (Active Noise Reduction) headsets on one ear and try and communicate over the cockpit noise without use of the airplanes intercom system.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1177,1177,1177,1177,3208,ATC cleared us to descend to 3;000 ft and slow to 180 knots and fly heading 360. We reported the preceding Airbus in sight. ATC gave us heading 300 follow the Airbus for the visual approach to 27L. Right after establishing the 300 heading; we encountered heavy wake turbulence. The autopilot disconnected as the aircraft rolled through 50-60 degrees and the 'Bank Angle' aural sounded. I used full aileron control input to stop the roll and established a heading of about 315 degrees. In an effort to increase spacing from the Airbus and side step the wake; I maintained that heading. To increase the stall margin I called for flaps 30 and continuous ignition to be added. The First Officer complied and notified ATC we encountered wake turbulence. The speed slowed below 180 prior to DEPOT and was at about 160 1.5 - 2 miles prior to DEPOT. Wake turbulence nibbled at the aircraft several times after the first encounter and we were very focused on controlling the aircraft and taking action to mitigate further loss of control. Another Controller then chastised us for slowing early and [then] he demanded compliance in the future. Because we were focused on controlling the aircraft; we did not adequately articulate the need for us to deviate from the ATC instructions. The controller was not able to interpret our notification of encountering wake turbulence as our having a difficulty controlling the aircraft.

1178,1178,1178,1178,5081,Our flight received a vector and a descent from Approach that resulted in overshooting the localizer; XXL at ZZZ. The aircraft was configured with flaps 20; airspeed set to 180 knots and we were between 4000-5000 about 15 miles out. I was uncertain what the aircraft would do in an overshoot situation and felt that we were still high energy. Not knowing the way the aircraft would react distracted me from the fact that speedbrakes were out and I was in FLCH. And we were descending to the cleared altitude; so I may have unintentionally guarded the throttles at idle. Other crew members alerted me to subsequent airspeed decay followed shortly by the stick shaker. I immediately selected close to max power briefly and the altitude quickly rose to between 500-1000 above cleared altitude. I disengaged the [autopilot] and recovered the aircraft to stable conditions and recaptured the localizer and glideslope. The remainder of the approach was hand flown.

1179,1179,1179,1179,7106,This was a flap/slat overspeed in the go-around phase during a moderate to severe wind shear encounter between 2;000 and 1;500 feet AGL.Contributing factors: Unexpected strong wind shear; moderate or greater turbulence at times during the encounter at go-around phase; night time; mountainous terrain; and IMC conditions once we climbed back during the go-around. We were fully configured for a full flap landing; having just entered the final segment and cleared to land on Runway 08R from the RNAV visual into LAS with the preceding aircraft in sight. The Tower reported wind 050 at 30 gusting 51. The winds previously reported were mostly aligned with the runway at 7 knots. We decided that a go-around was in order with those winds and the Captain called out correctly go-around TOGA; go-around climb; go-around flaps and I responded appropriately TOGA (takeoff/Go-around) set; climb set; and flaps 3 respectively; then I having said positive rate he called for the gear up which I did. It was at this time that we encountered the wind shear with a 60 knot gain and moderate or greater turbulence. The aircraft rocked left and right; and bucked with the turbulence. I distinctively recall hearing the dishes crashing down on the galley floor and the Captain saying we were in an escape maneuver.Accordingly; no further configuration changes were made at that time. I reported to ATC our go-around and they instructed us to fly runway heading and maintain 7;000 feet and I set that on FCU's (Flight Control Unit) altitude select; and heading select. With the thrust levers at TOGA it didn't take long to near that altitude but we were very much still experiencing the same wind shear and the Captain knowing the terrain around us instructed me to ask for higher; we were given 9;000 feet I believe. Runway heading would have eventually put us into a massive storm eventually so we asked for a heading but couldn't get a hold of the Approach Control momentarily.I believe at some point here he brought the power back to climb again but shortly after we experienced turbulence and wind shear again to the same level as before so I remembered he placed the TL (thrust levers) back into TOGA and instructed me to get a higher altitude as we began to turn to the southwest where we had arrived from; knowing there was no weather in that quadrant because we had just been vectored by Approach over this area during the arrival. I think at that point although not voiced out loud; in our minds we went back to a wind shear escape mindset. Since he wanted yet higher I set 13;000 feet; the MSA (Minimum Safe Altitude). The Captain again asked me to find him a frequency to get a hold of dispatch and I did comply; while trying to raise ATC which I was finally successful at. When they asked say intentions the Captain said we are going to divert; but that we wanted a few vectors first to contact Dispatch. It was during this time that I remember thinking I needed to raise the flaps so I went to the next flap setting; flaps 1. Then got busy again looking for a working frequency and setting up the number 2 radio exercising care not to cut out ATC which I was still communicating with in the heat of the moment.I believe we had reached or were about to reach 13;000 feet when it occurred to me to do an after takeoff checklist and then at that time raised the raised of the flaps. It seems like slow motion now that I remember it however it all happened too fast during the moment. I strongly believe that due to the severity of the wind shear and the turbulence our minds reverted to the fight or fly mindset and even though the aircraft's wind shear warning never went off; in our minds; the whole time we were in a wind shear escape maneuver until we leveled at 13;000 feet; the MSA and were able to feel safe from the terrain threat; since we were in IMC; night time; mountainous terrain area. This was the worst weather encounter of my career thus far; having flown almost 10;000 hours. I believe the Captain said something similar. We were definitely a little overloaded trying to stay safe and this partially contributed to an inadvertent flap over-speed.I researched our flight track. It showed us well clear of the storm cells that we received good vectors around but it looked like we had arrived at the same time as one of those storms that take place in the Southwest; that storm had surface winds of 71 knots according to the news and caused numerous damages on the ground. The aircraft preceding us on the approach went around as well as the aircraft behind us. Then a [company] flight made it in and then another one after him went around as well. We briefly considered our alternate of PHX but ZZZ1 was closer and it didn't entail flying around the weather so accordingly we diverted.We received numerous comments of appreciation from the passengers for keeping them safe. The flight attendants said that many people were scared and that a commuting pilot was reassuring them in the back. The flight attendants too said that was one of the worst turbulence encounters they had experienced. As for me as it relates to the over-speed; rather than being so concerned with accommodating the Captain's requests for getting a hold of Dispatch; I should have had been more concerned with monitoring the instruments; then I could have backed up the Captain as the flying pilot better and call out flap retraction; we did a good job at navigating because our first and foremost concern was to climb and steer clear of terrain; especially with the wind shear; night time; IMC; and terrain in the area. From that perspective; it was a job well done since we were aware of and mitigated the worse of the threats.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1180,1180,1180,1180,10322,[We were] on final airspeed 170 KTS minimum directed by ATC. On the glide slope selected flaps 15; aircraft accelerated to 180 KTS outside of FAF. Near the FAF dropped gear and flaps 20 and selected Vref+20. Aircraft was slow to reduce airspeed; still not at Flap 30 speed at about 1;200 FT AGL. Captain stated 'We're fast and may need to go around.' Approaching 1;000 FT I said we are going around. Pressed Go-Around switches called for flaps 20 (already there). Aircraft began to execute the maneuver with the autopilot on. I felt the pitch rate was 'too aggressive' and forced the yoke forward. Airspeed increased rapidly; I called for flaps 1 and then flaps up; and we got to flaps 1. Throttles moved forward I pulled them back then put both hands back on the yoke; keeping the aircraft from pitching up. Throttles then move toward full throttle and the Captain pulled them back and shortly took the controls. [We] climbed to 3;000 FT turned downwind as directed and shot the ILS again with no further problems.On downwind the Tower reported a 30 KT tailwind at 1;000 FT. In hindsight the aircraft responded as designed. When I limited the pitch up by overriding the yoke; the TMC added more power to get the 2;000 FPM programmed into the Go-Around. This caused rapid acceleration and I developed PIO (Pilot Involved Oscillation) fighting the automation. I should have allowed the Go-Around function to work as advertised; knowing there was going to be the initial pitch; and monitored. Then if a problem developed; remove all the automation and fly the plane. I became so focused on stopping the aggressive pitch up that I focused solely on that lost SA (Situational Awareness) and did not diagnose the true problem. The event was caused by my reaction to the 'feeling' of the aircraft pitching up in the Go-Around. Training with an emphasis on the Go-Around so the initial pitch up is expected. We do multiple go-arounds each year in the simulator but I did not expect the large pitch up at altitude. Possibly institute a 'Discontinued Approach' procedure to be used at altitude.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1181,1181,1181,1181,99,We became aware of an airspeed issue with our assigned aircraft on the morning we were asked to reposition that aircraft following its diversion that morning.  Shortly after arriving at the aircraft that night; and while the Captain was still reviewing the logbook; the Mechanic who had worked on the aircraft came up to meet us and answer any questions that we had about the discrepancy. Our main question about the work done was that there had been an overspeed and that there had only been a visual inspection done on the aircraft. The Mechanic explained that this was per the Maintenance Manual; explained the thoroughness of the visual inspection; and explained that internal damage would be reflected on the exterior of the aircraft.    Prior to departure; the Captain and I discussed being vigilant for airspeed issues during the flight. We also discussed other sources of airspeed information; namely the GS on the GPS Monitor page of the FMS; and on the ND. We also reviewed unreliable airspeed procedures; and talked about noting power-settings so that we would know what to put in to remain in steady flight if an indication problem occurred.    It was my leg; so the autopilot was on number 2. All indications and automation worked during the climbout; cruise; and initial descent. We were leveling at FL280; when I noticed the autothrottles adding an unusual amount of power. At almost the same time; the Captain noticed the airspeed on her PFD drop suddenly. This was followed by an ECAM for an ADC/IAS discrepancy. The airspeed on my side of the aircraft continued to match the airspeed on the Standby Indicator; and there was no change in the GS on the ND or GPS Monitor; so we were able to see that my indications were accurate. Since the number 2 autopilot was engaged; it did not chase the indicated airspeed on the Captain's side. This had been a big issue on the previous flight. The autothrottles did keep increasing thrust; so when the airspeed on my side started rising; I disconnected the autothrottles; and set them manually. At this point the Captain ran the ECAM; and selected the opposite side ADC. This seemed to solve the issue; and after several minutes we decided to retry the autothrottles. At this point they responded normally; and we were able to use them for the remainder of the flight.    The only unusual aspect of the malfunction was during the initial level off when the problem occurred; the autopilot became sloppy. We were at FL280; with 280 selected; but the altitude alert began chiming; and the autopilot started a very slow climb while in altitude hold mode. I selected a small vertical speed down; but the slow climb continued; approaching 150 feet high.  As I was about to disconnect the autopilot; the aircraft began responding; and once again leveled at 280; and worked normally the remainder of the flight. I believe that this all occurred after the ADC was switched; so I have no explanation for this behavior; and it seems similar to some of the automation issues that the previous crew experienced.  We discussed asking for priority from ATC; but decided that at worst we now had an automation issue; and that the aircraft seemed to be performing correctly. We did let Center know that we had experienced some automation problems that may affect crossing restrictions etc. Center passed that information along; but it ended up not being an issue.    We were very lucky in that we had the knowledge that this problem may occur. We were also lucky that it happened on the opposite side from the autopilot. I can see that for the previous crew it would have been very confusing with the aircraft pitching over; and the ensuing difficulty in figuring out what information was reliable.    This incident was very educational for me. I realized how important it is to see that there is nothing wrong with the aircraft; only the indications/automation; and look for a way to return to a steady state of flight.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1182,1182,1182,1182,8035,I departed Aircraft X for takeoff. Once approved separation was anticipated I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff. Once airborne I noticed the departures in a closer proximity than anticipated but I was providing visual separation. I verified that I had appropriate separation on the radar display. In my judgment speed and spacing was adequate and I switched both aircraft [to] departure. Not long after I was called by the Departure Controller that they needed more space between departures because I had less than three miles between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y. This is not typical of my best practices to ensure separation. A possible factor could be aircraft performance. I wasn't anticipating the trailing aircraft to be so much faster or the lead aircraft to under perform like it did. Both aircraft were similar types. Another factor could be that I had been medically decertified due to a COVID-19 exposure at the facility. I was not sick but I was only notified the day before this incident that my medical had been reinstated and that I was to report to work the next day.

When we were cleared for the visual approach to Runway 26. I thought we were a little high and close and in retrospect should have widened the approach out a little and configured more slowly and flown the approach profile closer to a 3.0 degree approach than was possible from our current position. I maintained altitude while disengaging the autopilot and auto-throttles and configured the plane for landing in an effort to increase drag and manage our descent more effectively for a landing. The approach maintained a steady rate of descent and configuration; but could not be considered a stabilized approach per the FOM. The approach was performed with the thrust levers at flight idle in order to reach the field in the touch down zone. While in the flare to land over the runway; normal configuration; I was attempting to effect a soft touch down; as well as landing in the touch down zone and in the process of the flare the stick shaker was activated as we touched the runway.

I checked in with him and did not mention the 300 knots speed assignment on check in nor did he ask. I was watching the aircraft ahead of me on TCAS get closer and closer. I called three times to confirm they still wanted 300 knots with no reply; maybe I stepped on someone and blocked the question. As our range continued to dwindle I slowed to 250. Just as we had slowed down two controllers started to harangue me about why I slowed down we were assigned 300. One of the exasperated controllers assigned me 300 knots and 7000 FT.

1185,1185,1185,1185,7046,Working Departure sector. Gorgeous VMC. The SOP allows ATCT to launch successive departures utilizing pilot provided visual separation. The ATCT must modify the secondary scratchpad in the STARS data-tag to advise the TRACON that pilot provided visual separation is being used. However; in this case the first aircraft is [a specific airbus model] and that type of aircraft is notorious for climbing out much slower than most other aircraft.According to the FALCON replay; the trailing [B737] is 1.55NM behind the [airbus] with a 60 knot overtake. I restricted the [B737] to 230 knots and requested the [airbus] increase to 250 knots as soon as possible. Despite those efforts the situation continued to compress. While I was aware pilot provided visual separation was being utilized; in my judgement the situation had become unsafe and I decided to break our noise abatement procedures and initiate an early eastbound turn for the [B737].

1187,1187,1187,1187,474,After configuring for a flaps 30 landing on my hand flown; visual approach to Runway 22L at BOS; we experienced what I believe was a strong gust. This occurred just inside the final approach fix. The indicated airspeed rapidly increased and exceeded the flaps 30 placard speed of 175 kts. (The approach report from ACARS; retrieved upon arrival at the gate; indicated we reached 176 kts). The flap load relief system activated and automatically retracted the flaps to 25. This is the first time I've experienced this aspect of the flap protection system and my first reaction was that I'd failed to properly configure the flaps.

1198,1198,1198,1198,1641,While being vectored for a visual approach to Runway 19R at TPA; Tampa Approach advised us of traffic which we attempted to gain sight of at about our 10 o'clock position and below us. We couldn't see the traffic however we had the airport in sight and reported that. At that time approach cleared us for a visual approach to 19R. We began slowing as we intercepted the final approach course to the runway using the ILS for additional navigation and awareness. At this point we were flying at 3000 ft outside of FADDI intersection. We were still attempting to locate the traffic visually but had a TCAS target in the vicinity of where approach advised. I noted that the traffic on TCAS was only 300 ft below our altitude. As we began to configure for the approach and landing we; as well as our jump seat observer; were still looking for the traffic. Approximately 1-2 miles outside of FADDI we got a TCAS RA of 'MONITOR VERTICAL SPEED' at which point [the] Captain disconnected the autopilot and followed TCAS instructions. Our jump seat observer then located the traffic as it was about to pass underneath us noting that he believed it to be a Piper. Shortly after the initial RA; we received a 'CLIMB' RA; at which point [the] Captain pitched up to follow TCAS instructions. This required greater than 1900 fpm climb rate. I monitored his maneuver to ensure he was following the TCAS and back him up. For a significant amount of time; I noticed the intruder aircraft was still 300 feet below our altitude. This led me to believe that the intruder aircraft pitched up and was climbing into us directly beneath us posing a serious risk of a collision. I also notified approach that we were responding to an RA. They acknowledged and asked numerous times prior to the end of the conflict if we can still make the approach. I ignored it until clear of conflict. Because we were already beginning to configure for approach; we already had flaps out. Due to this and the distraction by ATC we encountered a brief flap overspeed by 10 knot for between 5 and 10 seconds which [the] Captain immediately reduced power to correct the situation. Once clear of conflict and in a normal state of flight I advised ATC we would not be able to make the approach and would need to be vectored back around for another approach. The intruder aircraft did not maintain any kind of visual separation and appeared to even climb up toward us while passing beneath us. I do not know if this aircraft was under ATC control or was even in communication with any ATC facility. The floor of the Class B airspace where this occurred is 3000 ft MSL. Although the intruder aircraft was initially below the Class B shelf; when he began to climb while we were responding to the TCAS RA he entered the airspace. I also do not know if the aircraft had clearance to do so or not. With regards to Tampa Approach; when we advised we were responding to the RA the controller asked more than once if we could still make the approach or need to be vectored. This led to a distraction which made the situation for us in the cockpit more difficult.I do not know what can be done about the intruder aircraft because I don't know what his clearance was or if he was even talking to anyone. However; when an aircraft advises ATC of responding to a TCAS RA; they should respond with 'Roger' and standby until the affected aircraft advises no more conflict. Anything more is a distraction. They certainly should not be asking several times if the aircraft can still make the approach.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1201,1201,1201,1201,4693,We were doing touch and goes at ZZZ; the landings and the approach of the student were very good and stable. On the last landing the student landed the airplane slightly to the right of centerline and; being longitudinally aligned; I proceeded to put the flaps 0 so the student could apply full thrust and start another takeoff which is part of a normal touch and go. After applying full thrust the student wanted to catch centerline by applying left rudder; but the student overcorrected by applying too much left rudder and the airplane started to skid to the left side. Noticing the abnormality and now being on the left side of centerline facing about 20 degrees to the left; attempting a takeoff at an airspeed lower than rotation speed with flaps up would not be a good idea. I decided to announce 'my controls.' When I put the power to idle; applying brakes and aborting the takeoff; I started to use right rudder in order to catch centerline or at least being parallel the runway to avoid going outside the runway. Because of the speed and simple physics; the left main gear strut started to lower while the right strut started to rise almost putting the airplane in a side load situation when I decided to straight the nose wheel and keep applying the brakes plus aerodynamic braking. By that time I talked to ATC saying we are aborting takeoff. There was nowhere else to go but the grass. The airplane came to a complete stop on the grass with the engine still running when I used my checklist to shut down and secure the airplane. The student and I did a walk around the airplane to see if the airplane sustained any damage but there was no damage at all.

1204,1204,1204,1204,650,After picking up passengers for skydiving operations during the final load of the day; I began to taxi the aircraft as I have done numerous times before; crossing the threshold and turning right onto the taxiway. As I approached the taxiway; I applied right rudder to turn the aircraft and tapped the right brake to assist. I was taxiing at a safe and slow speed as I had done twelve times previously that day. On this occasion; I noticed the aircraft was not turning normally and began to drift left of centerline. At this point; I had already pushed full right rudder and had the brake pressed full down. The aircraft continued to drift further left of centerline as I began to assess the problem more. A skydiver was seated up front in the right seat and I assumed he may have inadvertently had his foot on the pedals; although all passengers are briefed not to touch controls. I informed the passenger to get off the pedals. He said that he was not on them and I quickly glanced down to see that he was not and to check if an object had found its way to the pedals. It was clear. I continually held full right rudder and brake attempting to turn the aircraft to no avail.The aircraft continued drifting left and I felt immediate action was further warranted. The taxiway is narrow and the ground slopes downward toward a fence. There is also a sign next to the fence which is wing height. I observed these objects previously and was aware of them. As the aircraft continued drifting left; while still on taxiway; I immediately put the power to idle and entered full Beta reverse attempting to utilize the prop and engine to slow the aircraft down. However; the momentum of the aircraft at only a few knots taxi speed continued to carry the aircraft off the narrow taxiway. I knew that if I went off the taxiway diagonal onto the slope the aircraft could possibly tip wing down and strike the fence. Therefore; I added left brake and it immediately brought the nose of the aircraft around and perpendicular to the fence. I attempted to use the emergency brakes while depressing both brakes and having the prop in Beta and full reverse.As the aircraft came closer to the fence; I feathered the prop in order to slow it down in case a strike would occur. The aircraft came to a stop approximately 6-8 feet from the fence line and did not strike any object or the ground. I continued with normal shut down procedures and informed passengers to disembark after shutdown. There were no damages or injuries as a result of this. The plane was pushed back onto the taxiway and taxied and the brakes were checked.I was informed by one of the passengers that another pilot stated that he had a similar issue with the brakes 'a few days ago.' After calling the Chief Pilot; I was informed that both he and another pilot had experienced similar issues with the right brake not working after picking up passenger. The Chief Pilot also stated that he believes it occurred after depressing the brakes for a couple of minutes during passenger pick-up. He informed me that no one had brought this issue to the attention of the mechanic because it had been intermittent and 'a couple of months' since happening.I called the Mechanic and informed him of the intermittent failure. I later met with the Mechanic and spoke with him and he grounded the aircraft. Some considerations from the outcome of this incident are communicating any factors that others pilots experience with all pilots that fly the aircraft. I; being a part-time pilot; fly only once a day during the week. I believe it is paramount that a strong level of communication is present between all pilots that operate the aircraft and conveyed this to the Chief Pilot. I always do brake checks during start-up and after every shutdown and had done them that day. The brakes worked throughout the day and I had not experienced any issues with the brakes previously that day or while flying this aircraft. It is my perception that communication between pilots could improve and I hope to work with the Chief Pilot in doing this.,"[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

I was plenty high at 500 ft on final; so I deployed the spoilers and realized making the runway was questionable because of late-day wind shear. I closed spoilers and figured I could make it to the grass under-run; which I did.

1208,1208,1208,1208,453,After landing; the typical chirp-chirp noise was not present from the two main gear; instead being chirp (from right wheel touching first (as expected) followed by a flop-flop from the left gear. My initial thought was that the left tire was flat; seemingly confirmed by the aircraft's turn to left. My thought was to exercise even greater care in steering control inputs if the tire was flat; so carefully input right rudder. While I quickly realized that the tire was rolling fine and the leftward turn must be due to another cause; some amount of runway width had been consumed. I increased right rudder input; but also needed to be careful not to turn the aircraft too sharply cause a bigger problem. Digging a wing into the ground would not have been an improvement. There were no persons on the ground to protect nor were their substantial structures or trees. Unfortunately; the runway width consumed prior to realizing the tire was fine was enough loss that I could not confidently turn the aircraft to the right fast enough to avoid leaving the runway to the left and damaging three lights on the side of the runway.I now realize that the removal of a left rudder input (part of a necessary late right-wing-low crosswind correction) has not completed prior to the nose wheel touching. Therefore the Archer's nose wheel steering linkage engaged and turned the nose gear left. Once it became clear that I was going to touch at least some grass; I was able to make two good decisions. First; I held the yoke full back; consistent with soft field technique. I am sure this reduced some steering authority in the last few feet of runway width. But a collapsed nose gear would have aggravated the problem. Second; I was able to steer enough that I could attempt to avoid any prop-first collision with a runway side light. I appear to have been successful. No prop damage was found. Also; no landing gear damage was found.The collision with runway side lights put two dents in the right flap and a dent in the wing leading edge near the root.I was considering a few additional factors that might be relevant because these can indicate technique changes that would prevent a repeat and might have other safety benefits.1. As a recent member; I have not flown this specific aircraft very much. It it the only aircraft I have flown that has wheel pants. This increases the mechanical components that can make noise during landing and can change the noise that I hear.2. Within make and model; there is variation among aircraft in the arm strength that needs to be applied to raise the nose in landing. I can be more ready for this.3. I can change my landing technique to be more nose high and nose high for longer after touchdown. A new normal to an increased nose high attitude will help clue my brain sooner to increase backward yoke force. Keeping the nose higher will give me just a bit more time to trigger and complete the removal of rudder inputs. 4. It seems unwise to take an aircraft and do fast ground cornering exercises to discern just how hard I can turn it to the right and left. It is hard to imagine making this part of pilot training. Though; I suppose CFIs could demonstrate not just slow turns but also some turns faster than one would normally want to do but still do not topple the aircraft. But from this experience; I now know that some additional amount of right steering input could have been applied. I don't want to find the limit. But I don't mind now knowing that more would have been possible. This was very frustrating to me; not knowing how sharply I can turn an aircraft once rolling on the ground.5. I do not know for sure what it sounds like when landing on a flat tire. I can try to find a recording on the internet; I can ask other pilots. But I know this particular sound is not it.At no time in the event did I feel that there was any bodily danger to anyone. And even though I was (and am) emotionally upset by it; it provides some confirmation that I can respond coolly in an event with increased and abnormal stress.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1209,1209,1209,1209,6020,I received my takeoff clearance from Tower and taxied out onto the runway.  The visibility was 3 miles with light rain and the winds were only about 7 KTS.  I had just flown in to pick up more freight so while I was taxing onto the runway; I was thinking about my previous takeoff.  When I departed; the aircraft pulled to the right; which is not uncommon due to the free castering nose wheel.  I lined up on the runway ran through my flow; and decided to hold the brakes longer to try and prevent the plane from pulling right.  As I put the power levers up; I glanced down at the torques and they were coming up even; so I let off the brakes to start the roll.  As soon as I let go of the brakes; the aircraft immediately took a sharp right turn.  This is where I made my mistake because I tried to get the plane straight instead of pulling the power and stopping.

As we were approaching the end of taxiway A and ready to hold short of Runway 11 PF(Pilot Flying) said I have no brakes.....I immediately got on the brakes and found we had hard peddles or pressure but no slowing of the airplane was noticed. I made a radio call to the Tower that we had no brakes and were going to turn onto taxiway A2 and onto the runway. PF could not make the hard turn without brakes and I told him to put it on the grass and that would stop us.....which it did. We still had the pneumatic braking system but we were going so slow by that point we did not use it; but because we knew we did have that system if needed; we decided to exit the grass and taxi back to the ramp where Maintenance was. Brakes were working again and 'appeared normal' but we were taxiing very slowly. The Tower asked if we were going to taxi back to the ramp in that condition.

After coordination with tower and rescue; taxiied in without further incident.Instructor will get several more landings in a tailwheel aircraft with another instructor prior to again flying a tailwheel aircraft solo or dual.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1213,1213,1213,1213,5992,While en route at FL250; we received a 'Flaps Fail' caution message. The Captain was the pilot flying and instructed me to inform Air Traffic Control that we were going to need to return to our departure airport. We were cleared to proceed direct to a fix and then the airport. I ran the QRH for a 'Flaps Fail' caution message and we advised the passengers that we needed to return for a mechanical reason. We contacted our Dispatch Controller through ACARS and advised them of our intentions. They agreed with us to return to our departure airport. The approach and landing occurred without incident. We landed visually on the runway. The touchdown at landing was very smooth. While we were rolling out on the runway; we received a 'Steering Inop' caution message and the aircraft began to veer right towards the edge of the runway. The Captain used a combination of thrust reversers and brakes to bring the aircraft safely to a stop. However; the aircraft came to a stop off the edge of the runway. We advised Tower and the passengers of our situation; and then contacted ARFF to do an inspection of the aircraft. They advised us they saw no signs of damage. We then contacted our Company Maintenance and operations to come out to the aircraft. Once they arrived; we asked them to do an inspection of the aircraft to ensure that no damage had been done. They also advised us that there were no signs of damage. We had them tow the aircraft back to the gate where we deplaned the passengers. I took a lot of time on my post-flight inspection to ensure there was no damage sustained. I noted that one of the torque link bars was twisted 90 degrees from its normal position; and informed the Captain and the mechanic. I believe that this event is a rare example of a dual failure situation. It is well known that the flaps on the CRJ 200 tend to fail. I believe we executed sound judgment in returning to our departure airport. The runways there are much longer; and the weather conditions were far better at the time than they were at our destination. Once the steering became inoperative; the Captain used thrust reversers all the way to the time the aircraft stopped. Normal company guidelines prohibit the use of thrust reversers below 60 KIAS. I believe that if he had not done this; our aircraft would have certainly exited the paved surface of the runway. We wrote up the use of thrust reversers in our maintenance logbook. I have made a recommendation to our company that we train for flapless landings more in the simulator; as well as nose-wheel steering failures.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1214,1214,1214,1214,8850,I was coming to land on Runway XX at ZZZ but was slightly off centerline and the nose was slightly pointed towards the left. When I touched down; the plane started to tip over towards the right and I reacted by quickly turning the plane left and it went off the runway. I was able to taxi off the grass and to Parking upon being instructed by the Tower Controller and without further assistance. No runway lights were damaged; nor the aircraft damaged. Winds were 110 at 03 kt.; visibility 10+; sky clear. I believe the runway excursion was due to not being completely aligned with the runway and causing the plane to side load upon touchdown. My initial reaction to correct towards the left immediately likely led to the aircraft going off the runway. Since this event; I have received flight training emphasizing correct landing and touchdown procedures and I feel more comfortable in my ability to respond should this scenario happen again.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1215,1215,1215,1215,3919,My student and I were coming in for our last landing.  We had already practiced four landings and this was our last one for a full stop.  Our landing was safe; a little left of center line but controllable.  After touchdown my student was forgetting to input right rudder.  I prompted him along telling him 'right rudder; use your right foot'.  At that time we were slowing but veering to the left.  I was starting to hop on the rudder pedals to correct the airplane when all of a sudden my student added full power.  The braking system for this aircraft is a hand brake.  I immediately grabbed the throttle to bring power to idle and reached for the hand brake.  But at this point we were accelerating pretty fast and going to the left side of the runway.  I was slowing the airplane to a stop when it went into the rocks on the side of the runway.  All three tires went into the rocks but the tail was still over the runway.  The airplane; the student; and myself were not injured at all.  The Tower had to shut down the runway because I did need help pushing the airplane off of the rocks. Myself and airport operations pushed the aircraft back onto the runway.  I inspected wheels; landing gear; and brakes everything appeared to be fine.  I started the airplane back up and was able to taxi across the runway; onto the taxiway to our parking spot.  After a thorough inspection the aircraft was not damaged at all; not even scratches to the paint.  Myself and my student were completely fine.  What I think caused this issue was that my student was trying to assure that our throttle was at idle; but he got confused that pulling throttle out means idle and pushing throttle in is full power.  So what he thought was idle was in fact full power.  We were in a light sport aircraft that can accelerate very quickly and does not take much power to move the light aircraft.  We did land to the left of center line so we were not utilizing the center of the runway which could have allowed us more time to correct the aircraft veering to the left.  To correct this situation and to insure it does not occur again I am going to be a lot more strict of landing on center line.  Also I will keep my hands very close to the brake and throttle just in case any confusion of the throttle input occurs again.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1216,1216,1216,1216,9485,I was out practicing normal landings with my student. We took off and were on 21L and then were switched to 21R halfway through the flight. We were dealing with a quartering crosswind most of the flight and it was getting gusty. Report was 169 true 14 gusting to 19. Wind was varying quite a bit. Right after the incident my student checked and it was gusting 21. We had to change our crosswind corrections continuously. On this last pass we touched down lightly and kept the nose off the ground. My student then took off the flaps and then I felt acceleration and thought he had started the go. We cocked quickly to the left as a gust hit us. I reached down to pull the throttle out and it was out; while pushing rudder to get the nose straight. We rolled off the runway and down a hill. Trying to avoid rocks and bushes we maneuvered to get the plane stopped. The speed with which we ran down the hill allowed us to hop over the ditch. We came to a stop about a hundred yards into the grass and let Tower know what had happened. They radioed the trucks for help. I checked all the plane gauges and all looked well. We asked the Tower if they wanted us to shut down; which they replied yes. We shut down the plane and checked it out. All looked fine. The fire trucks arrived and we were asked if we were alright. We then talked with the airport operation employee and wrote up a simple report of the facts. We were waiting to move the plane. After Maintenance towed the plane up the hill we taxied it back and noticed no problems with the plane. Throttle seemed to be fine with no changes.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1217,1217,1217,1217,4953,I was switched from approach control to tower at about 3 to 4 miles from the airport and at 3000 MSL.  I was informed to enter a right downwind and did so.  I performed my landing checklist and then entered a base turn.  I came into the final a little bit high and overshot the runway a bit as well; but that was corrected immediately.  I was under no pressure whatsoever by ATC to land quickly or get off the runway quickly.  I came in to land with 2 notches of flaps and was still a little high and a little bit fast.  As I was about to touchdown I started my flare too early and started oscillating.  When I eventually touched down the back wheels hit first; closely followed by the nose wheel.  I immediately could not keep the plane straight.  I could feel it drifting to the left and I tried to correct that with right rudder; but the plane was not responding that well.  It kept fish tailing and turning left and right on the runway and I had no control over it.  Eventually it took a hard left; not under my control; onto a taxiway where the nose wheel completely collapsed and the propeller struck the ground.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1218,1218,1218,1218,10554,I landed on Runway XX and my airspeed was approximately 76 knots. As soon as I touched ground; I slowed down in order to follow Controller directions. The Controller asked if I could make Taxiway Alpha X. By that point; I had already passed the taxiway and responded to the Controller in which I stated negative. The Controller's commands were to make a left turn at Taxiway Golf. I then proceeded to slow down and pulled back on the yoke to the turn left onto Taxiway Golf. Before fully exiting the runway; the tires of the plane became stuck on the snow ground and I was not able to move forward. The Controller questioned me and asked if I was able to move forward. I replied that I was unable to and that I was stuck in the snow. The Controller responded back and said hold tight; ground operations was on their way. As ground operations came; I shut off the plane and aided the ground operations staff in pushing the plane backwards. We successfully pushed the plane out of the snow.I started the plane back up and I was then able to make a U-turn back onto the Runway XX and taxi onto Alpha Y. The sign for Bravo (B) was not visible and I exited off of Alpha Y; made the left turn for Alpha and then right turn for Bravo.This experience taught me to avoid any taxiways that appear to have ice or snow on them. I also learned that I must make the judgement as being the pilot in command. As the pilot in command; I have the ability to deny requests made by Air Traffic Controller if I cannot adhere to their request promptly. I must note that it is important that all parties involved must remain safe; since safety is a priority of mine.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

1220,1220,1220,1220,6312,The aircraft was newly purchased. I had approximately 20 hours of time in the aircraft. We picked up the aircraft in ZZZ1 and departed for ZZZ filing a VFR Flight Plan after receiving a standard weather briefing through 1800WXBRIEF online. I conducted weight and balance and performance calculations for both departure and landing. We received VFR Flight Following throughout our flight to ZZZ.We landed at ZZZ as a fuel stop before continuing the flight to ZZZ2; where the aircraft is based. We filled the mains; and obtained food. I re-checked the weather and that it was in accordance with the briefing I had received earlier; and that it allowed us to proceed VFR on a route further south before turning north to ZZZ2. A VFR flight plan would not be accepted within the 30 minute window when attempting to file a VFR flight plan online; so we would be picking up VFR Flight Following from ATC once in the air using the inbound frequency. I performed another weight and balance; and also a detailed performance calculation since the ASOS was reporting a density altitude of 6;100 feet. Our takeoff weight was 3;532 lbs; with CG 81.1 which were both within limits. It indicated a takeoff roll of 1;800 feet; and a return to land landing distance roll of 950 feet. Initial takeoff performance was computed at 872 FPM. On climbout the passenger cockpit door burst open. This was very startling and severely impeded communications in the cockpit; and rendered the radio virtually useless. I determined that it was not safe to proceed; so we turned back to land at ZZZ. When I called on CTAF; there was unintelligible traffic taking the active runway for takeoff; so I entered a left downwind to runway. Due to rising terrain surrounding the airport in that direction; as I maneuvered to avoid the terrain I ended up high and fast on final. At approximately 200 AGL I determined I would not be landing on the fixed distance markers and initiated a go-around.The aircraft is Turbo-Normalized. I was instructed to leave the mixture lean during descent and approach; and to then advance the mixture during a go-around using the technique of mixture full; prop full; throttle full. When I advanced the Mixture and reached for the prop the engine sputtered and began to falter. I reversed course and leaned the mixture to regain the engine and determined that even if I landed beyond the fixed distance markers; my landing roll of 950 feet provided enough margin to bring the aircraft to a stop. I crossed the fence at approximately 90 knots; which is 10 knots faster than normal approach speed; and touched down approximately 1;500 feet down the runway. The down sloping runway and the position of the field contributed to illusions throughout the pattern that I was low; when in reality I was much higher than I thought. At this point I initiated maximum braking; anticipating the need to modulate the brakes. There was no appreciable slowing of the aircraft. I started retracting the flaps to get better braking action and began standing on the brakes to apply all the force possible and the aircraft slowed; but not at anything near the rate of performance that I had expected. We departed the paved surface of the runway at under 5 knots. Unfortunately there is no overrun to the runway and the terrain is unforgiving and canted at a steep downhill; and I continued to engage maximum braking until we struck a fence on the airport property. When I inspected the tire there were no bald spots or cord showing. I would have thought this would have occurred consistent with maximum braking. Nor was there any reverted rubber on the paint of the threshold number that I had passed over. When we came to a stop I immediately turned the fuel selector to off; turned the mags to off; and turned off the battery and alternator. I then surveyed the occupants of the aircraft for injuries. There were no injuries of any kind. We opened the doors normally and exited the aircraft. The rocky terrain had torn the left landing gear from the aircraft. There was [hydraulic fluid] on the ground and on the aircraft landing gear; along with the smell of light brush smoke in the area; so I removed the fire extinguisher from the front seat and as a precaution sprayed down the landing gear. I then went under the wing and sprayed fire extinguisher on the right main landing gear as a further precaution. We were able to open the doors normally and remove all luggage from the aircraft.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1221,1221,1221,1221,6731,Nosewheel steering was inoperative and on MEL.  Start-up; taxi and takeoff were uneventful and steering was easily accomplished with differential braking and thrust.  After gear retraction on takeoff I noticed that there was a lot of air noise coming from the nose wheel area and that the red 'unsafe' light was on for the nose gear.  Our speed was still below gear operating so I asked the First Officer to recycle the gear.  The gear came down normally with three green and no red.  When the gear was again raised the red nose gear unsafe light remained on.  I told the First Officer that we would have to return and have the situation remedied.  We were in and out of the clouds; so we got vectors for the ILS approach.  Gear was lowered and 'three green no red' lights were observed.  Landing was normal and on centerline.  I called for spoilers; which the First Officer extended; and selected idle reverse with the sub-throttles.  As the nose wheel was lowered to the runway the aircraft started a slight left turn.  I applied right rudder with no effect.  I got to full rudder; still with absolutely no effect; then applied full right brake; still with no effect.  I then raised the right sub-throttle to full reverse thrust and the aircraft continued turning left.  I could see we were going to exit the runway and we did at about 80 KIAS (best guess as I was not looking at the airspeed indicator!).  The ground on the left side of the runway is flat and very muddy from recent rains.  We went about 200 FT through the mud and the aircraft came to a stop about 50-60 FT off the runway.  I shut down the engines and got the passengers out.  There were no injuries; except to my pride.  When we left the runway we hit a taxiway sign and the left flap was damaged.  The flap damage appears to be the only damage to the aircraft except for a lot of mud mainly on the landing gear.  I believe that for some reason on gear retraction the nose wheel got cocked and possibly jammed slightly to the left.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

As I'm building time; I chose to do several more landings at ZZZ; where my owned aircraft is based. My approach was stabilized and on approach speed. I applied crosswind correction; touching down on my left main first. In this Cherokee the rudder is directly linked to the nose wheel. I believe that I did not align the nose wheel with the center line of the runway prior to the nose wheel touching down. Because of this; the aircraft pulled hard to the left and I veered off the side of the runway; through the grass; and came to a stop just short of the taxiway on the grass. There was no damage to the aircraft; and I was able to taxi back to parking on ground frequency without being given a number for the Tower. During taxing; handling characteristics were normal (I was able to taxi at normal speed with normal inputs) and upon shutting down the engine I inspected the aircraft and did not find any anomalies. The aircraft just completed its annual in March 2020 and has been flying well.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1224,1224,1224,1224,4087,Immediately upon touching down on the grass portion of the west end of the runway the left MLG brake began dragging; as captured in photographs; and the aircraft began to veer left. Fifty yards later the aircraft rolled onto the asphalt portion of the runway and the dragging brake veered the airplane even further left on a trajectory off the paved portion. The downward slope of the shoulder was water saturated soft grass and the left MLG tire sank into it and added further yaw forces. Full right braking was ineffective to arrest the veering trajectory and the aircraft departed the runway; rolled on the grass shoulder for 100 yards and finally stopped when the NLG drag brace collapsed and the propellor dug in over a swath of 50 ft. While removing the aircraft with a tractor the left MLG brake continued to drag.No casualties; including to pilot; and no property damage occurred. Since it did not meet the reporting criteria neither a NTSB or FAA report was filed.

1225,1225,1225,1225,5325,After a normal landing and deceleration on Runway XXR at ZZZ I applied normal braking and below 80 kts applied nosewheel steering both of which operated normally. Tower advise us to make a left turn on Taxiway XX; back taxi Runway XXL and take Taxiway XY to the ramp. (Note: All Taxiways and Runways were dry and free of contamination at the time) Turning onto Taxiway XY required an approximate 120 turn to the left to join. At this point the nose wheel steering was operating normally. After the turn the aircraft started drifting to the left; I tried correcting this with opposite nose wheel steering with no effect. I immediately tried to apply maximum braking to stop all aircraft movement with no braking action resulting; by the time I was going to apply Number 2 braking we were in the grass and stopped. We shut down the engines and we called the Tower to advise them of our situation on Taxiway XX. The Tower acknowledged our call and advised us someone from [company] would be coming to assist us. I exited the aircraft to check for any damage to the aircraft and any airport infrastructure; lights; signage; etc. and there was none. I called the Chief Pilot to inform him of the incident. The [company] representative arranged for a Tug and tow bar to assist us. The temperatures had been in the twenties so the ground was firm and the plane was returned without incident [company] coordinated the tow with the Tower for towing clearances and the plane was towed to the ramp without any incident.

1227,1227,1227,1227,4339,I was giving a private pilot a flight review in an airplane that he built (but no longer owned). He had about 65 hours in the airplane but I had never flown the airplane before. I was told the airplane had a current inspection and that the engine had just been test run on the ground. I checked the airplane myself carefully and we began our flight. Immediately on takeoff the cylinder head temperature shot over the red line and the Dynon sounded an alarm. Our takeoff was on Runway 19. We made a left turn to return to the field and land on Runway 28 as that was the quickest way to safely get on the ground. The landing was almost directly into an extremely bright sun that made it very difficult to see over the nose even though (or actually; because) the visibility was unrestricted. The landing was rough; but under control; and the rollout started normally. As the airplane slowed and lost rudder authority it began a gentle turn to the left into the wind. The airplane did not respond to the tailwheel steering and rolled off the side of the runway where the turn sharpened and caused the airplane to slide sideways to a stop. There was hardly any damage done to the airplane apart from a sheared wheel pin on the right main gear. The total estimated cost to repair is less than $100.00. Upon inspection after the landing we found a bolt missing from the steering linkage on the tailwheel. That was the reason we could not keep the airplane straight on the runway after it slowed down and lost rudder authority. The aircraft does not have differential braking; but only a 'Johnson Bar' where one lever applies both brakes. It would seem that I missed a loose nut and perhaps missing cotter pin on the tailwheel steering linkage or it would not have fallen out. A better preflight inspection should have caught this. In addition; after looking at the logbooks after the flight it was discovered that the condition inspection had in fact not been done and the aircraft was just over a month out of inspection. I should have checked the logbooks personally for this rather than rely on the aircraft owner who was mistaken.

1228,1228,1228,1228,7639,After landing I exited on Taxiway A3. As I made the right-hand turn onto Taxiway A; the right main gear departed the pavement and sank into soft mud. The effect was equal to applying full right differential braking and overpowered the nose wheel steering. In an instant; all three landing gear were in the mud. The aircraft had to be extracted with a tug and one taxiway light was knocked over. There was no damage to the aircraft. A combination of factors contributed to this incident: Patchy fog congregating at the edges of the runway and taxiways; my failure to keep the yellow stripe in sight and the nose-wheel on it; the unexpectedly sharp right turn (approximately 135 degrees) required and the resulting sharp point of unpaved area extending into the turn radius.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1229,1229,1229,1229,8450,During my first solo; I went to do a routine left-turn pattern and land on Runway XX of ZZZ. I took off of Runway XX and maintained best rate of climb. At 1700 ft. MSL I took called on the radio; and took a left turn for crosswind Runway XX. At 2000 ft. MSL I leveled off; and soon after called on the radio and turned downwind for Runway XX. Once I was abeam Runway XX threshold at 2000 ft. MSL; I began my decent for approach by slowing down and setting flaps to 10. I maintained an airspeed of 90 for the remainder of the downwind leg. I called on the radio and made a left turn for base. I maintained about 80 on the airspeed and engaged second notch of flaps. I called for final on the radio and engaged 3rd notch of flaps; maintaining about 70 on the airspeed. I descended on a stable approach and seemed to flare and touchdown just fine.The issue first developed as I tried to overcorrect for centerline placement after the plane had landed. I believe I overcorrected a bit too much to the right side; angling towards the grass on runway. At this point; afraid I would run into the grass; I attempted a go-around. The plane was able to get air-born just above the grass on the right hand side of Runway XX. On the way up; I believe I may have hit a runway edge light as I felt the thump on take-off. I initially thought it was simply the wheels touching the grass and continued on up. At about 500 ft. above the runway; I started to notice large amounts of liquid pouring out of the left wing. I quickly realized this was fuel and planned to complete another pattern and land. I continued the pattern similar to the way I completed it the first time but this time around; on the downwind leg; I reached for my phone which was in my backpack in the rear seat and called my flight instructor. Despite him telling me I can reach him on the radio; I elected to call him by phone because I felt embarrassed to call it over the radio; that I had an emergency. I told him that my fuel tank was punctured and he told me to land as soon as possible. I told him I would. I continued the pattern to land on Runway XX. I again attempted a normal landing but being much more nervous I made the same mistake of overcorrecting post landing. I pressed on the brakes as hard as I could and in the process veered off course. The plane went onto the grass and stopped.

The aircraft was heading to the left side of the runway and this point I over corrected to the right which caused the aircraft to veer to the right and go off the right edge of the 30 feet wide runway. The aircraft traveled approximately 100 feet and I corrected back onto the runway with the aircraft under control. I slowed the aircraft and taxied to the end of the runway; back taxied to the turnoff normally. The edges of the runway have a gravel strip about 2 ft wide and then mowed grass. The runway itself is asphalt. There are no runway lights at this airport. There was no damage of any kind to the aircraft or the runway.To the best of my recollection my approach speed was around 75 knots with 30 degree flaps. Touchdown was just past the numbers on center line. Wind was reported just prior to landing as 160 at 8 knots.My conclusion to this incident was excessive speed on landing and failure to control the aircraft on roll out. Contributing to it possibly was the fact this was the 4th landing I had ever made in this aircraft which we had recently purchased. Each preceding landing; the control of the aircraft on roll out seemed to be degrading. An inspection of the steerable nose gear has been scheduled.

1233,1233,1233,1233,846,This was the first flight of a tailwheel endorsement for a previously endorsed pilot who had lost his documentation. He had flown in Alaska in Super Cubs and had approximately 100 hours of tailwheel time. He is also used to flying transport category aircraft (Airbus). Two hours of ground school was accomplished covering tailwheel aircraft and model specific characteristics. The start and taxi; including control positioning was normal. The takeoff was somewhat erratic; in that the control yoke was slightly 'pumped'; rudder control was erratic but satisfactory. Slow flight at various flap settings and stalls were accomplished. On the first pattern; downwind to final was satisfactory; however; he elected to use 30 flaps instead of 40. As the round out was initiated; he 'pumped' the yoke initially but quickly established a proper attitude. As the aircraft touched down he relaxed back pressure and over-controlled the rudder causing a minor heading change. He then reversed the rudder; adding back pressure causing the aircraft to become airborne and changing direction. At this point I commanded him to add back pressure and freeze the yoke with a nose up attitude and center the rudder; however he relaxed back pressure; allowing the aircraft to touch down. His rudder input at this time was excessive (push and hold rather than the quick inputs required for a tail wheel). I took control of the aircraft (at this time we were very slow) but I could not override his rudder input in a timely manner. The aircraft performed a lazy ground loop; exiting the runway. It was more of a quick turn than a classic ground loop. I reentered the runway and taxied back to the ramp to perform an inspection; which found nothing wrong with the aircraft or tail wheel assembly. We then flew again; I demonstrated a 40 flap landing. I made him use 40 flaps and he performed with more precision and control for four more landings. I have around 5;000 hours of Instructor time with no incidents/accidents; trained many pilots; but committed a cardinal sin in having higher expectations for this pilot than warranted based upon his experience. Could this have caused me to relax my vigilance? It probably did. His first landing also was with 30 flaps; because the flap lever at 40 flaps requires the left seat pilot's right hand to have to go around the flap lever to manipulate the throttle. I should have required him to use 40 flaps as the touchdown is slower and the aircraft decelerates faster; allowing for more control. Obviously when he started pumping the yoke at the initial round out I should have taken the aircraft and performed a go-around. I also did not demo the first landing which is usually my method of operation- primacy of learning concepts would have helped here. This event reiterated; the absolute fact that a demo is also appropriate for someone who has never flown a particular model and [I should] never fail to take timely control of the aircraft though someone has extensive experience.

1234,1234,1234,1234,8171,I was landing on Runway 27. Winds were 16 knots from 190; a strong left crosswind. My previous landing had been on Runway 13; and I wanted to practice crosswind landings.I landed with the left wing low and nose high; slightly to the right of center-line. I lowered the right wing and then the nose. I raised flaps to increase brake effectiveness (per the POH).I believe the airplane initially swerved to the right. I then over-corrected and it swerved to the left. I did not have adequate directional control to stop the swerve. The aircraft left the runway into the (snow covered) grass on the left (upwind) side of the runway.There was no damage to the aircraft or to the runway lights; etc. The aircraft was removed from the snow with a tractor.I have landed in crosswinds stronger than this before.

I landed with no flaps and was aligned with the runway at touchdown of my right wheel. Then I felt the plane drift to the left and it did not respond to full aileron deflection; but continued to drift off into the gravel on the left side and then into the grass. I realized [if I were] to try and force the plane back I probably would have tipped back the other way or spun; so I decided to ride it out to stop in a straight line till stopped. Once stopped; the Tower asked if I needed assistance. I asked permission to shut down and inspect the airplane; which showed that the prop was not hit and the tires were ok. I then restarted the plane and was able to taxi back onto the runway and back to the hangers. In hindsight; I should have probably gone to a nearby airport with runways angled into the wind better.

Upon landing; student turned right to get off of runway in order to execute his full-stop taxi-back maneuver. When the aircraft did not turn right to his liking after applying full right rudder and differential brake; he shut down the aircraft to realign it and then continued his taxi. Upon reaching the hold short line at the departure runway of this uncontrolled airport; he discovered again that his plane was not turning to satisfaction and after making his entry call to the runway continued across it to the other side whereupon he manually adjusted its position again to get back onto the runway due to its seeming preference for right turns. He then initiated a take-off at which point the aircraft veered sharply to the left. The student pulled throttle to idle and applied full brake pressure; the lack of grabbing action in the right main brake assembly caused the plane to veer even more sharply left; off the runway to the left and into the grass infield. No objects were struck by the plane and the student shut down and exited in a safe and timely fashion. The aircraft was reviewed by a company CFI and Maintenance Technician and returned to service after a change of brake pads. Speculation is that improper use of the braking system over time caused a [glazing] effect on both the pads and rotor that limited the grabbing ability of the system at the time of the incident.

1241,1241,1241,1241,1658,Upon landing at ZZZ; I overcorrected due to being far right of the center line. My overcorrection was applying too much rudder (with possible accidental brake application) to the left to get back to center. There may have been a chance that the right wheel touched down first; then the left which amplified my overcorrection.The aircraft then made a hard left across the runway; exiting into the grass just before Taxiway X. Upon exiting the grass and entering Taxiway X; the aircraft clipped a taxiway edge light with the left wheel strut. The light was destroyed.The aircraft then continued across Taxiway X and came to rest in the grass just off Taxiway X but still in the runway safety zone.I contacted tower and they dispatched ops/emergency to me. With their help we moved the aircraft back on to Taxiway X; and out of the runway safety zone. There I was able to examine the plane and find the damage to the fairing on the left wheel strut; and uneven wear on the tires from the application of the brakes.

[The F/O] admonished the Citation pilot to go around 3 times. The aircraft did not deviate. Fearing a collision I advanced the power levers; simultaneously released the parking brake and [as] the aircraft moved forward the left main gear exited the tarmac and the left prop struck an elevated reflector.

Right as the speed levers were selected 'low' the aircraft made a sudden uncontrolled and un-commanded turn to the right. I depressed the NWS power-lever button in an attempt to regain control with no effect. At this time I recognized the loss of directional control and with my left hand turned the NWS switch to the OFF position; deactivating the NWS; and also commanded full reverse on the left engine in an attempt to regain directional control.

I asked student for sequencing way point after radar vectors? He paused and I pointed to his paper departure procedure (I required them to have paper as well as their Digital Fight Bag-as they seem to depend on electronics versus anticipating battery failure and being prepared accordingly). When I bent down to point and instruct student how to navigate a departure procedure and follow ATC direction after Radar vectors away from the departing airport; the aircraft creeped off the pavement slightly. As I felt the right main drop a bit; I immediately stopped. I tried BETA to back up onto the ramp. When it wouldn't return to the ramp; I used differential power to turn left and return to the ramp. On this short distance; the right prop clipped the taxi light. I felt a very 'slight bump'; analogous to a small divot in the taxiway.

1247,1247,1247,1247,8612,I was being trained in an aircraft L-5/OY-2. First landing went perfectly and taxi back for takeoff went perfectly. There was a wind from the east going mostly down the runway. Upon second attempt to land we lined up with the runway on approach and glide path were normal. I first heard the landing gear right tire squeak; the instructor said that the right gear had settled; then I attempted to get the left gear to settle on the runway. As I removed my crosswind correction; the right wing came up from a wind gust and I tried to get the gear on the ground while getting the right wing level. The left gear didn't settle instead of locking down or settling we rolled into the brush on the left side of the runway. If it had not been for a small ditch we would have rolled back onto the runway; instead with the power at idle the tires/landing gear settled into a small ditch which lowered the front of the airplane enough to stop the propeller and break one tip of the wooden propeller.I believe this unique aircraft has some peculiar landing gear qualities that need special attention for training on landings especially.

Our altitude assigned was 41;000 which was later changed roughly 30-45 minutes into the flight to 45;000 for light turbulence. The flight remained completely normal throughout cruise phase. We were given our initial descent at around 140 miles out; [ATC] continued us straight down to 3;000 and told us to report the field in sight. Once leveled off at 3;000 the aircraft was slowed and the field was reported in sight. The approach controller cleared us for a visual approach. We then entered a left downwind for [the] runway; the winds were pretty light and out of the east. Flaps 15 was initially selected on downwind abeam the middle of the runway center point. Base was then turned about a 45 degree angle from the runway and gear was selected down at this point; followed by flaps 35.

1249,1249,1249,1249,3427,Pilot performed a wheel landing touching down around 45-50 MPH (commented on by onlookers as a 'greaser' and perfectly aligned). Upon bringing the stick back to secure the tail wheel to the ground around 25-30 MPH aircraft immediately and violently pulled to the right leaving the 25 FT wide asphalt landing surface and ground looped 270 degrees on the adjacent grass/dirt landing strip. Rudder and stick inputs were not successful in recovering. Proper aileron/stick inputs subsequently kept the ground loop 'flat' therefore no ensuing and damage to the aircraft. Winds at the time were light and variable; and also referred to as calm. Aircraft malfunction was investigated by chief pilot/mechanic as possible cause. Upon disassembly of the Scott 3200 tail wheel; it was found that a notch was created internally on the rear portion of control arm hub. This 'notch' caused the tail wheel to lock in a 'reverse' direction and offset. This tail wheel malfunction caused the ground loop and no pilot input/actions were capable of breaking the tail wheel free and allowing directional control to be maintained during landing roll out.

1252,1252,1252,1252,4051,Just prior to takeoff rotation; we experienced a blown tire on the left main gear. The resulting debris caused significant damage in the wheel well area; resulting in complete loss of system hydraulics. We continued to climb out and elected to leave the gear down. We then accelerated and cleaned up the flaps. Next we completed the QRH checklist for Loss of System A. We did note; however; that there was no checklist for Blown Tire. We also communicated with ATC; Operations; Dispatch; the Flight Attendants; and Passengers. We then computed the landing data considering all inoperative equipment and determined that we had plenty of landing distance; while noting that it would be an overweight landing. We proceeded to fly an ATC vectored box pattern at 6000 feet and set up for an ILS to return. The approach was uneventful and touchdown was smooth. As soon as the nose gear touched down we began to experience a significant shudder attributable to the blown tire. The Captain was able to slow and maintain directional control until approximately 60 knots. Unbeknownst to us; the exploding tire had completely disabled left side brakes. As the aircraft continued to slow we began to lose rudder authority and the aircraft started to drift to the right. The Captain made every attempt to maintain centerline using tiller; rudder; differential braking; and differential reverse thrust but to no avail. We departed the runway surface to the right; somewhere between 20-50 knots. The aircraft came to a quick stop approximately 30 feet off the runway. The gear remained extended and no other tires blew. There were no cockpit indications of a fire or other damage and the Captain secured the engines. We completed the first few steps of the Evacuation Checklist just in case the need arose. There were no injuries to the Passengers or Crew and the Passengers were eventually deplaned via air stairs and taken by bus to the terminal. The remainder of the emergency was uneventful. In the turmoil that followed; we documented the blown tire and loss of hydraulics in the logbook; but forgot to enter an overweight landing. However; Maintenance was verbally informed of the fact a short time later. There needs to be a checklist in the QRH for blown tire. As emergencies go; this one is fairly common. That checklist should highlight all the applicable checklists to reference and the fact that a severe enough tire explosion may completely disable the brakes on that side and result in significant ground control issues.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1253,1253,1253,1253,10313,I finished flying the mission near the Jackson airport and continued towards the airport. While descending to the airport I checked the weather and received a clearance into the airspace and traffic pattern. The weather was 170 15G25 clear below 12;000 feet. I continued to the traffic pattern altitude and was cleared for a left downwind for Runway 20. It was quite choppy around the airport during my base to final turn as I descended further. On short final around 100 feet it became significantly smoother and I continued to land. I was configured to land with full flaps doing approximately 70 indicated on touchdown. I paused; then applied the brakes while closing the throttle. We rolled for 1-2 seconds then I felt a yawing motion to the right. It felt like my right main had locked up so I released the brakes to regain traction and used the rudder to maintain centerline. I asked my [passenger] if my right tire was flat or destroyed and he said no. I regained control of the aircraft; then I immediately felt a second yawing motion to the left followed by a wild spinning motion to the left. The plane rotated like a top 30-40 degrees towards the left while also pushing us towards the edge of the runway. I attempted to maintain centerline but felt too much force and thought I would roll it. I continued towards the grass trying to slow the aircraft and maintain directional control. I maneuvered the aircraft away from airport lighting into the grass and before entering the grass applied some pitch up to prevent flipping the aircraft. I kept the propeller away from the grass and kept pressure off of the nose wheel. Once we came to a complete stop I looked to my [passenger] to see if he was ok. The Tower radioed to us if we needed assistance and I said no. We taxied back to the ramp under the aircraft's power and parked it at the ramp. We were able to safely shut down the aircraft and secure it on the ramp. After the aircraft was shut down I inspected to see if there was any damage and found that the bolt holding the right wheel pan was missing and the wheel pan was loose.,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

1256,1256,1256,1256,3434,At the time of landing there was a gusting crosswind. Upon landing the plane  was fine until I completely pulled out the power and tried to slow. I got hit by a gust of wind and was blown towards the taxiway and ramp area. I then corrected; caught another gust; and was thrown onto one wheel and pushed back towards the safety area and a runway sign. The wind gust was too much to fight with so little power so in order to keep the plane and airport taxiway sign from coming close to each other I simply went with the wind and taxied into the grass. The airplane and airport were fine; no damage to either. I then asked to taxi back onto the runway and to the taxiway but was asked to wait for airport operations. Operations came and I was approved by them and the airport Manager to proceed to my FBO. The fire department then stopped me; made me shut down my engine; and would not let me proceed even though there was no damage and I had the instruction to continue to taxi. The fire department was very non-compliant with airport Operations and was trying to control a situation that they had no information about. They were told several times by Operations that I was cleared to go and still they refused to let me taxi or even help me get my plane off the runway area so the airport could continue to be used. While waiting for the fire department to remove their equipment from the runway I was able to push my aircraft into the non-movement zone and taxi to my FBO.

1258,1258,1258,1258,9555,This occurred during the final portion of my commercial multi-engine land checkride. I was flying the Seminole back to home base after maneuvers and shooting approaches at a [different airport]; while the examiner handled radio communications. When inbound from the northwest at 2;500 MSL; Tower cleared us for a right traffic; visual approach to Runway 21. After about a minute Tower told us to make a three mile final to the runway to provide clearance for traffic ahead including a helicopter.From my recollection; it was at this time the examiner requested a touch-and-go. The Tower responded unable and that we would have to do a full stop taxi back. After a moment of thought he confirmed with me that a full stop taxi back is what we would have to do. In my mind; I figured that the only reason he would be requesting a touch-and-go at this point would probably be to perform a rejected takeoff with an engine failure procedure; because this was the only maneuver not yet completed.Shortly after performing the normal landing and touching down; the examiner told me to 'slow it down just a bit' and 'let it roll.' As I gradually pressed the brakes he said 'well; slow it down more than that'; so I braked further. After slowing to roughly 20 knots; I was told to go full throttle. A few seconds after doing so he pulled my right throttle. At this point I incorrectly braked first before pulling the left throttle a moment later; causing the plane to jerk to the right. My left tennis shoe had then become caught between the left brake and the 'lip' of the lower instrument panel; stuck in a position that only provided a fine amount of brake while I tried to pull it free. This coupled with the right engine inoperative made matters worse as we immediately veered right off of centerline. I quickly exclaimed 'I don't have it' as this happened; and my only response was to brake with the one foot that was still able to; and try to force my left heel into the left rudder. In a matter of seconds we had swerved right; I exclaimed again that I don't have it and that my foot was stuck; the Examiner pulled one of the mixture levers; but by that point we had and gone into the rocks; and struck a taxiway light off of the runway exit corner. We shut down the plane; exited; and the examiner immediately called to report the incident; and emergency responders arrived to assist and tow the plane back to the ramp. Luckily the plane and the crew were unharmed.It was my hurried response to the situation of braking before closing the throttle that caused the accident. I was focused on stopping the plane as quickly as possible rather than taking my time to first maintain centerline; and perform the appropriate procedure. There was certainly some failures in communication that occurred between the examiner and I prior to practicing the procedure; given that moments before; I was under the impression from the Tower that I was to be conducting a full stop taxi back first. This was likely done in order to end the checkride sooner; since it had gotten off to a late start; and was running over into another student's scheduled time.

Landing was smooth and as airspeed bleed below 40 kts.; tail settled to ground smoothly after slightly floating. Once tail was on the ground; it felt like something bit into my right main and aircraft canted hard right. Full left rudder and left brake were applied but I was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft as it skidded towards the runway edge at approximately 35 degrees. As the aircraft slowed and braking became more effective; the aircraft canted back towards the left and stuck the wingtip on the ground and came to a stop on the runway. I noticed that I had trouble moving the aircraft on the ground due to an issue with my right main gear but was still able to taxi off the runway.

In that configuration with our planned landing weight and the current conditions entered; we had in excess of 4;000 FT of stopping margin for our runway. A normal stabilized ILS and landing was performed on Runway 34R. The touchdown was well within the touchdown zone. Normal braking was encountered during the entire landing and rollout. The center section of the runway was fairly free of contamination considering the amount of snow fall and accumulation. The rate of deceleration was even increased as a result of the 20-24 KT winds that were blowing almost straight down the runway at the time of landing. At around 60 KTS; I transferred control of the aircraft to the Captain. We were instructed to exit the runway at Taxiway WD and contact Ground. About 200-300 yards prior to the turn; the Captain stated he was going to do a brake check. The braking at this point seemed good and the aircraft appeared to respond normally. As we approached the taxiway; it was apparent that the runway conditions beyond Taxiway WD seemed to be much worse. It also appeared that there had been no attempt to treat and/or plow taxiway Intersection WD.The Captain slowed the aircraft to a slow walking pace as we approached the turn. The first 30 degrees or so of the turn seemed to be normal; but at about the 35-40 degree point of the turn; the aircraft seemed to start sliding. At this point; I started to confirm with the Captain that he was turning or stopping. I said multiple times; 'turn; turn; turn;' to which his response was; 'I am; it's sliding!' At this point; I actually pressed on the already full right rudder and brakes; but the aircraft didn't respond at all. As we approached the edge of the taxiway; the nose wheel finally caught traction and the aircraft slowly turned back to the right and back onto the center of the taxiway. As we performed our after landing flows; I notified Tower or Ground that the braking action on WD was NIL. I made this report more than once to a Controller who almost seemed irritated at the report and instructed the aircraft behind us to also exit WD.As we were taxiing to the ramp; the aircraft that landed behind us confirmed the braking action on WD to be NIL; and also advised the Ground Controller that it appeared that an aircraft had struck a taxiway light(s) on WD. This was the first indication that we may have struck something. At no point during the slip/skid did we have any indication of anything striking the aircraft. There were no abnormal engine indications and/or sounds/vibrations etc. We elected to continue our taxi on two engines to the gate because of the slippery ramp conditions. Upon arrival at the gate; the Captain contacted Dispatch and the Chief Pilot to discuss the events. It was noted that during a post flight inspection; the only damage to the aircraft was the two nose wheel tires had a gash in them. No injuries were reported to any crew or passengers.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1262,1262,1262,1262,2307,I had a relative near miss on the runway after touching down on Runway 13. I encountered another airplane in head-on fashion over the runway. I had been traveling to EDC; an uncontrolled airport with an elevation of 620' MSL. We requested and received 'flight following'; which was cancelled within 10 to 15 NM of the destination airport; EDC. From that point on; [we] were squawking 1200; and our communication was limited only to the CTAF for EDC Traffic.I was the Pilot-in-Command and my [passenger]; no piloting experience; was in the co-pilot seat. For the first 50% of the flight; our cruise altitude was 4;500'. Increasing clouds at 3;000' and above necessitated a descent allowing us to remain VFR. Within 20 to 30 NM of EDC we encountered a progressively lowering cloud base. Around the airport; the AWOS-3 reported a ceiling of 1;300' AGL. From 6 to 8 NM out; I was flying at 1100' AGL +/- to be clear of the clouds as I prepared for entry into the traffic pattern; which was left pattern for both Runways 13-31; the main airstrip. There is another small strip; 16-34 which is 1550' x 25' also at this airport; but it is used on a lesser basis to my understanding. Based on AWOS-3 weather information; I secured prior to being in the immediate vicinity of the airport; the winds were favoring Runway 31. Because the cloud base was low; I could not overfly the field. Thus; I determined well north of the airport that I would circle the departure end of the runway in leftward direction and join the left pattern for Runway 31 on the south side of the airport. Mistakenly; instead of circumnavigating to the south side; I stayed on the north side; being distracted by the extension of my downwind and preparing for landing. The bottom line is that my radio calls when approaching the pattern and within the pattern indicated that I would land on Runway 31; but because of my mistake; I landed on Runway 13; the opposite end. After VFR Flight Following was cancelled; my first radio communication on the EDC CTAF to announce my position and intentions was made at 6 NM north. I made another call at 3 NM north. I then proceeded to make radio calls when I joined the left downwind leg of the traffic pattern; when I announced I was going to extend my downwind leg in order to give landing traffic; a bit more separation; when I turned onto the left base and when I turned to final approach. During the time I was approaching the airport and when in the traffic pattern; the only other communication on the radio came from the [other aircraft]. I did not have the [other aircraft] in sight; but after he made his position call that he was on his final approach; I started my base turn. When the [other aircraft] announced that he was clear of the active runway; I then made my radio position call that I was making my turn to final from 0.7 NM out. From this point until my touchdown; no other radio calls occurred on the EDC CTAF frequency. When I was touching down and still at high speed on the rollout; only then did I spot the troubling profile and landing lights of a light twin aircraft coming from the opposite end of the runway. It was 20 to 30 feet in the air at the point I first caught sight of it. It was traveling over its left side of the runway and I was on the centerline. The twin started to veer to the right a bit. In order to give it a wide berth; I started braking such that my plane was on the left (my left) side of the runway; eventually resulting in my left main gear traveling briefly beyond the asphalt edge of the runway; but not far enough to get conflict with the runway edge lighting. Within a few seconds of seeing his movement to his right; I saw him resume a path to his left side of the runway; thus maximizing the distance of our separation. I quickly regained directional control and returned my plane fully onto the runway surface. I slowed the plane normally with braking and proceeded to the end of the runway. As I reached the numbers at the end of the runway; I learned of my runway orientation error. A plane was holding short at the taxiway there (he communicated that he was waiting for IFR Clearance); so I back-taxied to the next available exit and brought myself clear of the runway. As such; I made the radio call announcing that I was clear and taxiing to the FBO.By the time the twin and I were abeam on the runway; we were approximately 150' apart. The pilot of the other plane made a radio call at that point admonishing me in extreme terms (not exactly sure what he said because of a strong accent). This is the first time that he made any kind of radio call on the CTAF frequency. I do not know whether he was taking off; landing or 'going missed' on a practice instrument approach. No one was injured; no airplanes or property was damaged. Obviously; I learned a tremendous amount from my involvement in and post-analysis of this happening.Contributing factors:- My mistake of landing on the opposite end of the runway at this uncontrolled airport was a significant contributing factor. - Also contributing heavily was the lack of communication by the 'near miss' twin; as to his presence; his position and his intentions were unknown to me or likely any other aircraft in the area. - Another factor was the low cloud ceiling.....this prevented me from overflying the field at a higher and suitable altitude. Thus; I was not able to make a final double check of runway orientation and surface winds. - Despite setting my heading bug to align with the desired Runway 31 several miles from the airport; I neglected to scan the HSI again as I traversed the pattern prior to landing.- The fact that this way my first flight with my brother as a passenger could have contributed; as I went to exaggerated effort to explain to him each and every action related to our pattern activity; approach and landing process. It is possible that this could have distracted me from completing my traffic pattern so that I was landing on my desired Runway 31 instead of Runway 13; the one on which I landed.- The fact that the plane that was holding short at the end of Runway 31; did not make a radio call with their position/intentions either. Thus; I was not scanning for aircraft holding short as I was on my final approach.....regardless of which end of the runway they were on.,"[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1267,1267,1267,1267,3364,Just prior to the FAF I had some light rain but could still see the runway.

When I landed speed brakes were deployed but when I started braking it didn't slow down so I kept applying more and more until I was hard on them and nothing was happening. By the time I realized I wasn't going to stop it was too late to go-around and I just kept applying full brakes. Just before we ran off the runway I steered it to the left to avoid the approach lights and came to a stop 390 FT from the end of the runway. I shut down the aircraft and let the passengers out. No harm came to the passengers and I managed to clear the runway lights causing no damage on the airport property. No apparent damage on the aircraft other than having gone down in the mud to the axle of the tires.I got back in; called Unicom and gave them my number so they could pick us up.

1269,1269,1269,1269,8437,I was on the ramp at the FBO which is located at the end of the taxiway. I had received my IFR clearance for departure on Runway 7 on the clearance frequency. I then switched to the ground frequency and requested taxi clearance. (It was now well after sunset) I was told to taxi to Runway 7 via Foxtrot. I left the ramp and made an immediate left. Upon reaching Foxtrot 2; I realized that I wasn't actually on Taxiway Foxtrot; but was on a parallel road which was intended for vehicle traffic; not aircraft. I stopped at Foxtrot 2 and notified Ground control what had happened. I informed them that I could make a right onto Foxtrot 2 to get on the Foxtrot Taxiway. The controller notified me to hold my position and that he would send an Ops (Airport Operations) vehicle out. About 5 minutes later the Ops vehicle arrived behind me. The ground controller notified the Ops vehicle that I had stated that I could make the turn onto Foxtrot 2. The Ops vehicle approved that which I did and I made the right onto Foxtrot 2 and then left onto Taxiway Foxtrot and proceeded to the hold line for Runway 7 without further incident.After making the wrong turn on what I thought was Taxiway Foxtrot I did see a sign with an F on it with a black background on my right which is why I thought I was on Taxiway F. As I proceeded towards Runway 7. I commented to my passenger that there were several dips in the pavement which was unusual. As I approached F2; I saw a red sign past F2 indicating no entry. That's what was literally the red flag. Fortunately; I was in a high wing aircraft which cleared all lights and signs. This may not have been the case in a low wing aircraft. This second road was not shown on my airport taxi diagram which might have helped. I don't know if anyone else had ever made this same mistake; but I think better signage would have helped. Perhaps a sign coming out of the ramp on F1 indicating 2nd left to Foxtrot or a red no enter sign like the one at F2 might have might have also helped.

Following that call ATC instructed me to squawk 1200 and advised frequency change was approved. I then switched to the CTAF frequency for ZZZ1. I monitored the CTAF for traffic and started my radio callouts approximately 10 miles north west of ZZZ1. I checked the weather displayed on the MFD which indicated a four kt. wind and altimeter reading of 29.93 and there was light rain. Since the wind was calm I decided to land on Runway XX; the preferred runway. Runway XX requires right traffic. I entered the right downwind for Runway XX at 1;000 ft. (pattern altitude).

1272,1272,1272,1272,197,I understood the departure clearance to be [to] climb to requested VFR altitude and proceed direct to destination from having been restricted to 080 heading and at/below 2;500 FT; VFR. We climbed to 1;500 FT and turned on course. [We] were later queried on our heading and if we were still on the 080 heading; but had actually turned to 050 on course. Upon arrival (same flight); winds were reported at 250/12 in the ATIS. I requested the runway with more direct wind for landing. Upon landing; the winds seemed much stronger and were quite gusty. I had been up for 18 hours upon landing; having come in from China/Alaska the night before and [my] body hadn't adjusted to time change. I bounced on initial contact with the runway heading straight. Rather than executing a go-around which is a great idea in a Cessna 195 bounced landing recovery; I added a little power and attempted to get the mains on the ground in a wheel landing. I pushed slightly forward to pin the gear and bounced again prior to touching down for the third time with a slight drift due to a gust of wind. At that point; the aircraft started to veer left so I corrected. When corrected; a gust of wind hit the upwind wing and drove the downwind wing into the runway scraping the tip. I recovered the wing low attitude; but was weathervaning into the wind in a small skid while trying to bring the aircraft to a stop. While trying to bring the aircraft to a stop; we departed the runway onto a taxiway and came to a complete stop between two taxiway lights on the edge of the taxiway. The Tower asked of our condition to which we responded we were fine and needed to taxi to parking which we did under our own power under the direction of the Ground facility.,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1273,1273,1273,1273,4553,I checked the weather and received VFR flight following from Nellis Control. I remained east of the Nellis restricted areas throughout the flight. I was in the terminal phase of the flight when the winds began to pick up and were not as forecasted. There was a significant crosswind at ([my destination]) so I chose to divert to (U08). U08 does not have an ATIS and I was guessing the wind from the windsock and a departing helicopter that reported the wind as north at 25 knots. After overflying the field a few times I began to run low on fuel. The crosswind turned into a direct crosswind at 35 knots (exceeding aircraft limitations) and I began to run low on fuel. I made the decision to land diagonally across the taxiway; across the smooth gravel that is between the taxiway and the runway and ultimately onto Runway 31 at an angle. My GPS indicated that my groundspeed on the approach was approximately 17 knots and I rolled smoothly across the gravel to the runway. There was no damage to any of the runway environment or the aircraft. My ground roll was approximately 150 feet. In order to execute the landing safely I had to overfly a few structures that were not lined up with the runway...This may have startled residents of the town. I had already cancelled and switched from Nellis Control and my datalink weather and ATIS reports of all of the surrounding airports indicated significant crosswinds as well. I made the decision to not switch back to Nellis to declare an emergency because there would be no services they could provide to me at that point. There is a vast distance between airports with fuel on the east side of the Nellis Complex.

I should have said unable; thinking about it now; but at the moment; I tried to exit on to taxiway W even though I was too fast. This resulted in my aircraft skidding off the runway and I entered the grass area on the side of the runway. At this point the tower asked if I needed any help and I told them I am going to try and get back on the taxi way; which I did. Following which; the tower asked me to standby for a couple of minutes and then they asked me to taxi back to my flight school. At this point; I switched over to ground frequency and requested taxi back to my flight school.

Tower instructed crew to maintain 8;000 FT overfly the runway and expect a right turn and was told to contact Approach; that the crew complied with. Approach vector aircraft to new destination for the visual approach to Runway 35R. The crew loaded the ILS 35R approach into the Collins FMS to back up the visual approach to Runway 35R. The inbound heading was 280 that was inside of the final approach fix; 2 miles before the FAF crew advised Approach that the airport was insight. Crew was given a clear for a visual approach to Runway 35R and to contact Tower who gave a clear to land. Crew armed the approach mode to intercept the final course and the autopilot began a turn to final 1 mile inside of the final course; because the auto-tune will not turn properly if the vector is inside of the final approach fix.

1279,1279,1279,1279,5666,According to my student: While he was doing solo touch/goes at ZZZ; on his second landing; he touched down left of centerline. While rolling with the throttle in the idle position; he turned off the carb heat and began to retract the flaps. The nose of the plane began to veer right. When he applied left rudder he said the plane felt as if it would skid; spin or drop the nose onto the ground. Therefore; he applied just enough left rudder to straighten the nose wheel and rolled onto the grass adjacent to the runway. No contact was made with any runway signage or lights. There was no damage to plane; runway; or grass area; and there were no injuries. Tower cleared for continued movement to the Alpha taxiway. He continued to the transient parking area and called ZZZ Tower per their instructions.As the instructor; my student called me to inform me he had run off the runway; no damage had occurred; and he had spoken with the tower and FAA. I did not know he was flying by himself that day and had received no notification from him. I asked him to recount what happened to me several times trying to understand what happened. I called the Tower and confirmed that the winds were variable at 3 knots and visibility was very good. Based on his recount; I do not fully understand how he thought going off the runway was his safest option. I have not offered him any training or instruction that would indicate that was good judgment. He has never landed far off centerline with me in the plane and has never demonstrated that he would ever act in such a way. He and I have logged extensive dual hours at ZZZ doing pattern work; and he has never flown in a way that indicated he would act or make a decision in this manner. He had demonstrated consistently with me that he was able to maintain directional control of the airplane both in the air and on the ground. I have informed him that all of his solo endorsements are no longer valid. I was planning to spend an extensive amount of time with him on the ground and in the air addressing what happened yesterday through re-training; but he has decided to discontinue his flight training at this time. As a result of this incident; I have re-clarified to all students that they must inform me of any time they plan to solo and must receive my permission before doing so. I have also implemented a strict rule of no solo touch and goes.

This gust lifted my left wing (while I had full right aileron in for the winds favoring the front right quarter of the aircraft) to which I responded with left aileron. With this correction; the gust promptly lifted my right wing and the aircraft then weathervaned to the left about 20 degrees. I immediately neutralized the aileron and applied right rudder in an attempt to realign the aircraft with runway heading. As I departed the runway surface; I immediately applied full power and initiated a go/around. The aircraft did not hit any airfield lighting/signage. No damage was sustained to the aircraft/airfield. The time from the initial gust to the go/around was approximately 3 seconds.I re-entered the VFR pattern and landed without incident. This time; I taxied more slowly to parking without incident (with a little less than 1 hour fuel reserve). Lessons learned include: keep flying a tail wheel aircraft until it is in the chocks; manage taxi speed appropriately for the current conditions; do not allow other traffic in the pattern to adversely pressure how I operate my tail wheel aircraft; consider an alternate airfield with wind conditions more suitable for the aircraft and my experience level.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1285,1285,1285,1285,9047,When attempting to set takeoff power the left engine did not produce more than 25-30% torque. After verifying that this was not due to a momentary lag of torque; which I have experienced on many Metro engines/takeoffs; the takeoff was aborted however the plane was heading to the left of center line due to the higher torque achieved by the right engine. When the power levers were brought to idle the plane straightened down the runway to the left of the center line. The nose wheel steering button on the power lever was being pushed but either it was not working or was not effective enough to turn the plane back toward the center line. I verified with my left thumb and finger that the nose wheel steering switch was in the armed position and also pressed the 'park' steering function for additional turning help. When I (quickly) recognized that wasn't working left power was applied with the hope that there would be some power and right brake was applied to try to turn the plane to the right however; it didn't work and instead the plane started turning to the left and exited the runway where the plane stopped and was shutdown.

1286,1286,1286,1286,9717,I was on the ground having just arrived with my daughter at the Cafe adjacent to the terminal building and control tower. We had just walked into the terminal near the restaurant when I heard someone shout 'Oh No!!!' I then saw a few people rush to the restaurant window that faces the runway; ramp and taxiways adjacent to the runway... was the active runway and as I recall the winds were reported 220 @ 8 knots. I immediately saw a yellow Piper Cub headed down the runway in what looked to be a 260-280 heading....it appeared that both main tires were either in contact with the ground or where just slightly above it...it was hard to tell...his heading continued to progress away from the active runway midline and toward a row of hangers on the northwest side of the airport...I kept thinking to myself 'I hope that he does not try to take off' as he did not appear to have adequate speed to climb and surely would have stalled if attempted...it should be noted that his tail plane was flying with the tail wheel being up off of the ground as it left the active runway; passed over the 'grassy' area just off of [the] runway; and over taxiway Bravo. I believe that his tail wheel did come back down to rest after having past all three....he then seemed to either strike the hanger or ground loop the plane between the hangers....Then spun in nearly a 180 degree turn to the right when it finally came to rest; left wing down on the ground; left main wheel strut broken; and nose pointing back toward the runway and direction he had just come from. I had no idea if he was trying to land and then execute a go around; or if it was his take-off roll; because I did not see him until he was approaching near mid field; and shortly thereafter headed off of the runway and to the right (Northwest) I felt that the pilot(s) did an incredibly good job of dodging the side of the hanger which surely would have caused much greater damage to the hanger; their aircraft; and possibly to themselves from a physical standpoint....when the plane stopped moving; I noticed the prop turned a few more times before it finally stopped. I don't know if it struck the ground or not....I was very pleased and thankful to see the pilots exit the aircraft on their own and could be seen standing off to the side. Some of what I witnessed was from the viewing area directly beneath the tower; and after the plane came to rest I moved out toward and onto the south ramp were I could see better and to make sure that the two pilots had been able to extricate themselves.A fire department fire engine arrived on scene near the tower within a few minutes; but they were on the wrong side of the field and needed to exit back out around to the Northside of the airport in order to get closer to the scene. At least 2-3 other fire rescue vehicles were seen to arrive to assist shortly thereafter. The airport ramp vehicles; maintenance personnel; were on scene very quickly; along with a few bystanders who seemed to already be over on the North side of the airport...possibly aircraft owners or pilots...I was not sure. I witnessed no fire from my vantage point.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1287,1287,1287,1287,7300,We arrived at ZZZ to pick up additional passengers enroute to our final destination. We encountered no ice or braking action problems on the landing rollout. We took on fuel; picked up six passengers for a total of eight; restarted engines and taxied to the deicing spot. After deicing; we performed a tactile wing inspection; got our clearance and ran the before takeoff checks. We then announced on CTAF that we were departing the runway. I applied takeoff power to both engines while the pilot not flying called out airspeeds and engine parameters. At approximately 1;000 FT from the end of the runway we hit a patch of ice under the snow. I felt the right main gear begin to skid and the aircraft veer to the right. I applied left rudder pressure to correct the drift but we continued to skid. The pilot not flying called the drift and yelled 'go left; go left' but the aircraft wasn't responding to my inputs. We exited the runway surface and continued approximately 200 FT before coming to a stop in the snow and mud. We shut down both engines and asked the passengers if they were OK; to which they replied that everyone was uninjured. We told them to sit tight while we examined the aircraft for damage and possible fire hazards. After determining that there was no risk of fire we deplaned the passengers.

1288,1288,1288,1288,7798,Local show time was approximately XA:00. This was 55 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff time. (XA:55Z). Airfield conditions were night operations with no visibility issues. Upon arriving at the aircraft at gate; maintenance informed us of a write up requiring deferment (Auto Speed Brake System). There was also a problem with the Captain's seat belt. The maintenance issues lead to a block out time of XB:45Z (:50 late). During taxi out; #2 DEU failure caused a return to the terminal. After maintenance was performed; the aircraft blocked out for the second time at XD:36 (2:46 late). Ground control cleared us to taxi to Runway XXL and [along the route hold at] Taxiway X. Taxiway X and Taxiway Y are both at the approach end of runway XXL with open tarmac between them.  Taxiway Y is nearest the beginning of the runway. Also; there is a flange on the west end of Taxiway Y to facilitate a high-speed turn off from runway XYR. The width of the widest part of this flange is approximately equal to the runway width.Approaching hold point Taxiway X; tower instructed us to hold short of holding point Taxiway Y. There was a wide-body aircraft holding at Taxiway X; which was subsequently cleared for takeoff. As that aircraft was rolling for takeoff; we were instructed to taxi into position and hold. We entered the runway area via holding point Taxiway Y. A yellow runway exit line curved to the right toward the runway centerline from hold point Taxiway Y. Hold point Taxiway X was to the left; which allowed the full length of the runway. We expected full length. There was open tarmac between these two runway entrances; so we turned about 45 degrees left to maneuver the aircraft to a position closer to the beginning of the runway. When the aircraft was turned right to align with the runway; the yellow line leading to the runway centerline was not evident and the right runway-edge line was mistaken for the runway centerline. The captain set the brakes and transferred aircraft control to the first officer. During the turn to the right to align the aircraft; the first officer was scanning for possible malfunctions associated with the multiple maintenance issues leading up to this point. After transfer of aircraft control; I noticed there was a notable lack of runway markings in this hold position. In my mind; this was attributed to being on an open ramp area prior to the beginning of the runway. I expected normal runway markings to be just ahead. A lack of familiarity with this runway and the large open tarmac between the hold-short area and the runway contributed to this misperception.  After receiving takeoff clearance and during the initial part of the takeoff roll; the first officer's attention was inside focused on setting takeoff power. During this time; the aircraft was aligned with the right-side runway edge lights. As the flange narrowed from right to left to meet the edge of the runway; it became apparent that the centerline was to the left. With rudder pedal steering; the aircraft was maneuvered to the left to join the centerline. The maneuvering occurred after setting takeoff power and runway centerline was achieved just prior to 100 knots. All maneuvering was in the low-speed regime and it was not apparent that we impacted any runway lights during the takeoff roll. We elected to continue the takeoff. The remainder of the flight was uneventful. After blocking in at ZZZZ1; we discovered that one of the nose wheels sustained notable damage to its sidewall.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"
1289,1289,1289,1289,1202,I was an instructor in a multi-engine aircraft flown by a properly rated student who has about 12 hours flight time in the plane. The incident was a high-speed aborted takeoff that led to a runway overrun through the stopway. In the process; the left tire blew. Other than the tire; no damage was noted to the aircraft or airport property. The runway was closed for [a few] hours while the tire was changed so the aircraft could be towed.We briefed the departure and knew the departure runway was 3900 feet long and that our accelerate/stop distance was 3400 feet. Our CG was at the forward end of the permissible range. Also; a flaps-up takeoff was selected. Upon reaching rotation speed; my student rotated and I felt the plane slowly come off the ground and into ground effect. I sensed my student try to gain airspeed by lowering the nose and he then pulled up again and did not get the response he anticipated. He elected to abort the takeoff; brought the throttle to idle; and once the plane was back on the ground; he applied max braking. I believe there were two factors that led to the incident: 1) the flaps-up takeoff; although permitted according to the Airplane Flight Manual; provides a longer ground roll and increased the accelerate/stop distance. 2) The forward CG also leads to a longer takeoff roll and may have contributed to the lack of responsiveness my student felt. We discussed a takeoff with standard flaps; but my student mentioned that he was more comfortable with flaps-up in the event we lost an engine on the takeoff climb. I thought that was a reasonable position. However; we had the option of departing on Runway XY which is [longer]. Electing to depart from Runway XY would have greatly mitigated the risk of an overrun. Also; the aircraft was 400 pounds below max gross takeoff weight; so we also could have put more weight in the rear of the passenger area to move the CG aft and increase performance.,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

Switching to CTAF; I heard an aircraft announce that he was taking off on runway 3. Since I was approaching from the west I chose to execute a landing on runway 3; in the calm wind situation. After touching down and slowing I experienced increasing loss of lateral control; culminating in a ground loop to the left with damage to the right landing strut. Upon exiting the aircraft quite close to the windsock; I noted that the wind was a direct tailwind of 5-7 knots (as judged by the sock position) with gusts.All indications were that a landing on runway 3 was appropriate; but a query to CTAF prior to the landing attempt for confirmation of the no wind report would have altered my choice of runway.

While adjusting to go back onto the runway off to my right; the wing tip tapped the ground. After pulling back onto the runway I checked for any airframe damage. There was no damage that I could feel or see besides the propeller. A way to prevent this problem from happening is to practice landings at different airports around the area and not just be contained around the general area.

Ground flaps and brakes were applied according to CE-525B operating procedures. Braking action was consistent to wet runway conditions with no issues of traction or stopping power as experienced by the PF. PIC (Pilot in Command) requested controls from SIC (Second in Command) to further test the braking action. Prior to the transfer of controls; the aircraft was nearing normal taxi speed. Transfer of controls was made; and the PIC determined the braking was excellent and returned controls to the SIC. (Prior to exiting the runway; a communication from another aircraft was heard on Tower frequency reporting they had clipped taxiway lights and braking nil while exiting at the end of the parallel runway.) PF slowed the aircraft to a near stop and exited the runway at [Taxiway] XX. Once the aircraft was turned and exiting the runway; PF informed the PM that sliding was occurring and there was no directional or stopping control. The aircraft slid laterally and came to a stop with the left main in the grass on the left side of [Taxiway] XX exiting the runway. Break thrust was applied in an attempt to move out of the grass and the aircraft began sliding again; making a left 270 spin. With both engines at idle; the aircraft was again sliding laterally. The left engine was then shut down which stopped the slide. ATC was notified and checklists were performed. The aircraft was towed from XX to [the] hangar where post flight actions were conducted.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

1301,1301,1301,1301,2853,ZZZZ2 Runway XY PAPI was NOTAM Out of Service (OTS). Thus; Runway XY was unusable due to terrain and Company limitations. The prevailing winds almost always favor Runway XY in ZZZZ2. Prior to departure I requested the Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS) alternate to be revised from ZZZZ2 to ZZZZ3. Release #2 didn't indicate the change I requested. During flight I was unable to place a call to Dispatch via Satcom and had to communicate with Dispatch via HF patch. It was very difficult to communicate with Dispatch; nevertheless; I was finally able to verify the ETOPS alternate was changed to ZZZZ3 prior to entering ETOPS airspace. It became a challenge for me to receive my 90 minutes of FAR 117 rest requirement; nevertheless; I was able to barely receive it. The Satcom system installed in ZZZZ3 base aircraft [are] often unusable in this part of the World.In the past; I have asked Dispatchers why they assign us ZZZZ4 as an ETOPS alternate. The answer I sometimes receive; 'This is the ETOPS alternate assigned to the optimized Flight Plan (OFP).' This is not what I want to hear as a Captain. There needs to be more thought and human interaction in the planning stage prior to Dispatch accepting an ETOPS alternate produced by [the computer]. For numerous reasons; ZZZZ4 and some other island airports should not be accepted as an ETOPS alternate.Prior to departure; Runway XY PAPI was NOTAM OTS. Winds were slightly favoring Runway ZA in ZZZZ2. However; TEMPO forecasted the winds to favor Runway XY. ZZZZ4 was experiencing heaving rainstorms and was forecasted the same. The Dispatcher did not assign an alternate; instead provided us with FAR island reserve fuel of two (2) hours. If we had to divert to ZZZZ3 due to weather; winds; Runway XY PAPI being out of service; etc. we would have landed with approximately 3;000 ~ 4;000 pounds of fuel in ZZZZ3 per release #01. Of course; this was unacceptable to me. The Dispatcher contacted ZZZZ2 Ops to verify the status of Runway XY PAPI. According to the Dispatcher; the PAPI was back in service even though it was scheduled to remain OTS by our arrival time. Attached is a message from Dispatch I received via ACARS indicating the ZZZZ2 PAPI was back in service. I added additional fuel to provide me 6;000 pounds of fuel over ZZZZ3. The agreement with the Dispatcher was I would carry the current payload and fly at a higher altitude than flight planned with the understanding I would configure the aircraft early for landing burning the additional fuel required to land at 146;300 pounds. This would provide me 6;000 pounds of planned fuel over ZZZZ3 prior to beginning the approach in ZZZZ2.During flight I received an ACARS message from Dispatch the ZZZZ2 Runway XY PAPI was intermittent. Please refer to attach ACARS message. How does the PAPI status in ZZZZ2 change from back in service to intermittent within less than 2 hours? As the Captain; I agreed to accept the current OFP considering the Runway XY PAPI was back in service per Dispatch. Throughout the flight the winds slightly and consistently favored Runway ZA. Base on the winds; we elected to configure early and burn the require fuel to land Runway ZA. Initial approach fix inbound a moderate rainstorm moved over the airport and the winds began to shift. Approximately 300 feet above touchdown zone elevation; we had an 18-knot tailwind and elected to do a go-around. At this point; ZZZZ3 was not an option due to our fuel status; ZZZZ4 was not an option due to experiencing heavy rainstorms; obviously ZZZZ2 Runway ZA was not an option due to the tailwind and ZZZZ2 Runway XY most likely would not be an option due to the PAPI status of intermittent. We were boxed in without any good viable options! We chose to fly the ZZZZ2 Runway XY RNAV approach. The plan was to fly the approach all the way to minimums. If we didn't have stable PAPI guidance by minimums and we would miss the approach. We would then deviate as necessary from any FAR; FOM; FM requirements to get the aircraft safely on the ground. Fortunately; we had stable PAPI guidance and landed the aircraft safely without further event.I was flying with two new First Officers. I explained to them my decision making process of adding additional fuel in ZZZZ and how quickly island weather can change; forecasted or not. After landing in ZZZZ2; one First Officer stated; 'the weather changed as quick as you predicated it could change!' There should be additional training and experience level for some of the Dispatchers. They need to better understand the challenges we face in island flying in the [Island airports] system. For example: Don't just except ZZZZ4 as an ETOPS alternate because [the computer] produced it and it is legal. A better understanding of why landing single engine in ZZZZ4 at night is not a good idea. 1) It is not a good idea due to the short Runway. 2) The airport lights may or may not be operable. 3) Even though the airport may appear to be open; by the time we arrive the Fire Crash rescue and Airport Operations would have not arrived at the airport. This has happened several times in the past when diverting to ZZZZ4 in a non-emergency situation. There needs to be a better understanding of prudent fuel requirements. Many times I have received FAR minimum fuel over alternate and had to call Dispatch to increase it. In some instances; the Dispatcher could not understand why I was unwilling to accept approximately 3;500 ~ 4;500 pounds of fuel over an island alternate. What if we had a new Flight Crew and a new Dispatcher to the system? This is not a good combination considering the current training and experience level.  I got the feeling the Dispatcher was overloaded with work. When asking for important information for the Station Manager and for my flight; he was unwilling to answer my questions. He cut me off in a rude manner and to say the least; he was less than professional!We need better island airport infrastructure; maintenance; approach landing system options to name a few of many necessary island airport improvements required. Lately; PAPI at other island airports have been NOTAM OTS. Even though it is legal and not limited by the Company; it is not in the best interest of safety to land at night without visual guidance at these island airports with short Runways. The illusion a pilot receives flying into these airports at night; is like flying into a black hole.As the Flight Crew; we need a better and more stable Satcom system in our aircrafts! HF communications in the ZZZZ3 system is very challenging and sometimes impossible! During flight and on the ground in ZZZZ2 we were receiving ACARS messages 30 ~ 60 minutes after they have been sent/requested. The ACARS system data transmission was blocked up with excessive data. Thus; causing us not to receive important and necessary messages in a timely manner. Ultimately; this issue including other factors caused an approximate one-hour late arrival in ZZZZ3. By the end of this pairing; I was fatigued.

1302,1302,1302,1302,7777,This is a fatigue report. For 4 months now our trips are seeing significant changes. When I bid; I bid based on how I prefer to fly; this includes fatigue mitigation measures that I set for myself from years of flying experience. Many of the specific characteristics of a trip that I bid away from are being imposed through last minute changes. Min rest overnights that were originally 30+ hrs specifically bid for; Deadheads; 4 legs in a day to airports I bid away from; operations during times I generally avoid like late at night and extended check out times that eliminate 'commutability.' The constant fight to receive correct pay after a trip changes is affecting all of us; it's a significant distraction amongst many right now. These all add fatigue to each trip and each pilot is different in their preferences.Changes occasionally are part of the job and we all adapt as necessary. The continuous changes we are seeing every trip are building into chronic fatigue issues and little mistakes are becoming more frequent. If changes are here to stay; then the personal protections we bid for to mitigate our own personal known fatigue areas need to be considered. Just because the changes fit the footprint; doesn't mean they fit the pilot. We bid for a reason! This report is associated with a gear overspeed also directly reported. I own that I let it happen; under normal circumstances I would have caught it. I ate my humble pie and moved on; but see more and more of these events happening if we don't protect our schedule changes. This was the 2nd to last leg of a 4 day that saw many changes and 3 min rest overnights in a row. The fatigue issues listed here are an important factor in understanding and preventing future little mistakes that ordinarily wouldn't happen.The only option we have to avoid known fatigue issues imposed into a trip is to remove ourselves from that trip and those issues. Crew scheduling provides absolutely no flexibility when awarded trips are changed; yet we show up to find two Reserves put on our original awarded trip with a great overnight we cherry picked. A lot of us have pushed through for several months now; but our Certificate is more important than being overly flexible. We all appreciate having the work and the ability to do our jobs. But these constant changes are adding up and becoming very fatiguing. Comply with Section X.X of the procedure for schedule changes and honor Bid preferences and awards. Limit the number of min rest overnights to 1 per trip change.

1306,1306,1306,1306,9486,A 1200 foot broadcast tower near the Pearland Regional Airport (LVJ) in the Houston; TX area has been partially to totally unlit for the past several years.  It has been totally unlit for at least the last four months.  It is located approximately 3 miles south of the airport and within approximately 1.5 miles of the instrument approach to Runway 32.  NOTAM's are repeatedly issued for the tower; but it seems to never get fixed.  As evidenced by the Army helicopter crash into a NOTAM'ed unlit tower near Waco that killed seven people; the NOTAM solution really isn't a solution.  It would seem that the tower operator is abdicating his responsibility to maintain working lights at the expense of safety.  A check of the NOTAM history will reveal how long this situation has persisted. I contacted the FAA; who replied that they had no enforcement powers and that this function was governed by the FCC.  I've filed a complaint with the FCC and received a response that since the tower owner was maintaining NOTAM's; there was no violation (email from local FCC enforcement officer pasted at bottom).  I find this to be an incredible situation. A tower owner can skate by for years using the NOTAM system; effectively negating any incentive to spend the money to light his tower; while putting the rest of the flying public at risk.  This is a tall tower near a busy airport in the metropolitan area of the fourth largest city in the US and it has been totally dark.  Unbelievable. I also find the FCC's response to this issue to be unacceptable.  They seem to be in no rush to force the tower owner to meet their established lighting requirements.  There is no reason in the world that it should take this long for a tower to get a lighting system installed. It's done every day on towers all over the world.  At the very least; he could put temporary strobes on it. Email response from FCC;  'I received your complaint concerning the light outage on Tower number 1052126 near the airport in Pearland; TX.  The owner is maintaining a NOTAM so there is no FCC Rule violation.  The owner has had the lighting repaired multiple times; but the lighting kept going out.

1307,1307,1307,1307,8189,I am filing this report due to an ongoing safety concern with regards to unsafe tooling for changing the tires on the A320/319 aircraft. The tooling in question is the poorly designed socket in the Tire Change Kits at the Terminal and Hangar. Last year; 2011; I strained my back due to this socket slipping off the [axle] nut while torquing a tire on an A320 and I was off work for over a month and went through several sessions of physical therapy. Tonight; I was involved with another A320 tire change and nearly a year later; I see nothing has been done to replace or fix this unsafe socket. After I came back from the hospital last year just after injuring my back and before going home; I had sat down with several Mangers; Supervisors and a company Safety Representative and discussed ideas to fix and redesign this socket. I am upset that nothing has been done to fix this. The potential for injury to me and my co-workers still exists; not to mention damage to the axle nut and possibly improper torque of this nut; from the sloppy fit of this tool. My most important concern is to keep co-workers from getting hurt like I was last year.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Due to rain showers along the STAR plus other traffic; Center had kept us at 250 KIAS and too high to make RIICE at 10;000 FT. Center was informed and said to just do the best we could; so this was not an issue.) Center had released us from the 250 KIAS speed restriction (the other traffic was no longer a factor). Out of about 16;000 FT I used vertical speed plus speed brakes to make RIICE at 10;000 FT and 250 KIAS. Out of about 11;300 FT; we were handed off to Approach. Several things happened at once: (1) the FMC went into 'ALT ACQ' mode (v/s window blanked); (2) aircraft was decelerating to 250 KIAS; and (3) Approach cleared us down to 8;000 FT. The Captain (PM) went to set the MCP to 8;000 FT; but the aircraft was still in 'ALT ACQ' mode with the speed still about 290 KIAS. I raised my hand in front of the MCP altitude window and said; 'Not yet. It's still in 'ALT ACQ' mode; wait until we see 'altitude hold'.' The Captain waited until it went into altitude hold mode; then he selected 8;000 FT; I then waited until we were at 250 KIAS before pushing 'level change' to descend to the new assigned altitude of 8;000 FT. We did not deviate from altitude or airspeed during the event. The purpose of this report is to show the types of events that are possible with the new procedure of PM setting altitudes in the MCP; while on autopilot. If I; as the PF; had been in control of the altitude selector in the MCP during the descent (old procedure); I would have delayed the setting of the new altitude in the MCP until it had gone into 'altitude hold' mode; thus eliminating the potential for an altitude deviation.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1314,1314,1314,1314,4804,On departure; I missed a couple ATC radio calls. They were normal clearance calls and not urgent; but I just plain missed the calls. I also noticed that ATC communications with multiple instructions (heading; altitude; frequency; etc.) were difficult to mentally process and read back. I feel I was suffering the effect of accumulated fatigue. When we got to cruise; I tried to move around and get the 'blood flowing;' had a bite to eat and was able to complete my duties as pilot not flying for the duration of the flight. I noticed on the radio that many other 'company' call signs were also completely missing radio calls and miss-repeating clearances. These were call signs that I could distinctly hear and all of them were having difficulty with ATC of one kind or another and making mistakes. As the night progressed; I heard at least two times of ATC trying to contact 'company' flights multiple times with no response.The Captain and I discussed the issues at length during cruise. Both of us admitted to being more generally tired (on and off duty) than ever before in our careers. In all of our conversations with other pilots we are hearing the same story of being 'beat;' 'exhausted;' 'tired;' 'worn out' and even the dreaded 'fatigued.' The general consensus is that our work schedules have gotten so bad that we are unable to rest and recover when home or off duty. It is common to hear pilots complain that it feels like they are never home any more. First let me say that I am no slouch. I believe in doing an honest day's work for an honest day's pay and have worked hard all my life. Since the advent of FAR 117 and Company schedule changes; the pairings and monthly schedules out of my domicile have progressively gotten worse. These abuses of an airline-favorable regulation (117) and the perceived dumping of a lot of 'bad' flying on my domicile appears to be taking a toll after 5 months of accumulation. Myself and all pilots I speak with agree that an accident is not a matter of 'if'; but of 'when'. From what I heard on the radio on this night; the 'when' may be soon. For the first time in my career; I legitimately know what fatigue feels like. For the first time in my career; I am legitimately afraid of putting my loved ones on our planes. FAR 117 needs to be reviewed now that we are six months in. From all pilots' point of view; it has made things far worse than they have ever been before. We are ALL more tired and burned out (including our off-duty lives) than ever before. Company schedule creation policy needs to be reviewed. Domicile schedules have continued to erode over the last several years. It is finally taking its toll and starting to catch up with all of us. Company crew accommodations policy needs to be reviewed. Pilots generally agree that the quality of crew accommodations has eroded in line with the pairings. It is getting more difficult to get a good rest and almost as importantly a good healthy meal at many of the hotels in which we are now being placed and this is contributing to overall fatigue. Is it going to take an accident to fix these issues?,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1315,1315,1315,1315,3653,I agreed to call in fatigued as a crew for the following reasons: 1) The Captain appeared extremely fatigued at the time. 2) We had sat around 6 hours and were all experiencing that 'tired dullness' you get with a rolling departure time slip. 3) Although still legal; our duty day was in jeopardy. Assuming we pushed 45 minutes after our assigned aircraft blocked in; we would need minimal ground delay to takeoff and stay under our maximum duty day. 4) We observed the weather getting worse; freezing drizzle with ice and snow pellets. Our experience told us the taxi out and deice would be lengthy and contribute to our lack of mental alertness and undoubtedly bust our duty day. 5) Finally; we projected ahead 8 hours to our arrival; approach and landing; that made us feel uncomfortable given the high terrain and a weather forecast that was marginal. So instead of fueling; catering; loading cargo and passengers and then hopefully pushing within duty day and hoping that we would experience minimal ground delay that would include deicing and then somehow magically feeling refreshed after an Atlantic crossing to execute a high threat arrival; we decided as a crew to make the fatigue call and put a stop to an unsafe chain of events that was being linked together.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1316,1316,1316,1316,1072,New Integration procedures and changes to SOP. I was Captain on this Airbus 320 Equipment. This fall 2013; the Company instituted new Phase SOP and Checklist changes dramatically changing the Preflight to takeoff SOP in the Airbus 320 Fleet. I have now flown about 8 legs under the new system and feel compelled to report my observations. I went into the changes with an open mind completing the computer based training early and reviewing the documents describing the changes. What I have found upon flying the new procedures for about 2 weeks on the line is a set of changes that I feel degrade the safety of the operation and load up the pilots in critical pushback and taxi time periods. The new procedures take much of the regular planning and briefing items and shift them to taxi out taking the first officer to a heads down workload at some of the busiest times on taxi out. I have tried several different methods to try to make the new system work for me; but whether it is on single engine taxi out; or two engines; whether we get the weights before taxi or later in the timeline; it still loads us up. It seems by the time we takeoff we have been doing checklist after checklist; and discussing items that could have clearly been taken care of at the gate. In my opinion the new system is prone to cause a mistake more likely and even more so to cause violations; or misapplied taxi instructions just due to the chaotic flow of the new procedure. Starting with the preflight setup it begins pushing workload by preventing loading of V Speed Data; and performance during the setup. I see no reason why we should wait to discuss planned flaps and speeds at the preflight level. Professional pilots are adaptable to change items later if needed; but why not alleviate the delay when a high percentage of the time the pilots know generally what to expect for departure? This is the first point that I feel needs to be addressed. I do not see any problem with the Before Start Checklist and its format works EXCEPT for the glaring change away from checking the speeds; checking the FLEX temp; Altitudes in the FMC at this lower workload; quieter period. To make us do all that on taxi out is a mistake. I've seen it over and over now on the 8 legs that we are loaded up going heads down during taxi out while we should be focusing on the taxi and FAA instructions. We have to modify this new procedure before someone bends metal or gets violated for missing turns. The next spot on the procedure I feel was not well thought out is the After Start checklist. We push the final weights loading; and setting of the flaps to a time period when we are usually in a crowded alley or taxiway with other aircraft waiting on us; but we are sitting there with the RADIOs off doing this new SOP. It doesn't work well. We should already have the data loaded; and all that discussion taken care of. It is just as bad when we go on one engine as we still are waiting and loading up all that work to the taxi out portion. It is a terrible flow and should be reconsidered. The next point I'd like to address is all these checklists. After Start; Delayed Engine start; Before Takeoff checklists; newly loaded up with many more points. If I am told it is streamlined then I have to disagree; I have done 8 legs now and I feel loaded up all the way to the runway. It's not a good system. I am very senior in my equipment and although newly trained in this fleet most of the first officers I fly with are very high time in the fleet. I do not look forward to the day when the new hires start showing up trying to integrate all this work into the taxi out. I'd like to add another point here. I have to wait on the flaps setting in order to do my control check. I do not like to be taxiing around getting FAA clearances and moving while doing that check. The new procedure almost forces me to do that. It is not smart and I do not feel comfortable with the change making us wait on the flaps until we are taxiing; forcing the control check at that time which pushes me to do that critical check while trying to navigate at the airport. I haven't decided how I'm going to address this but needless to say the new SOP is not good. I could stop on the taxiway; but is this really necessary? This is much safer to be completed at the gate area as we set the flaps to our planned setting and do the control check there. Just a few seconds and its done; and we don't have to divert attention on taxi out. I'm not resistant to change and I went through the entire gambit of changes on the 757 before moving to the Airbus but I can say the new changes in this Phase are mostly change for the sake of saying we did it. It is not a well thought out SOP. Please revisit this new Phase and fix it (UNLOAD us on TAXI OUT) before someone bends metal.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1317,1317,1317,1317,983,We were departing LAX and were cleared via the LOOP 7. We anticipated a departure from the north side of the airport (24L) since our departure route was to the northeast. However; we thought it was possible that we could be assigned [Runway] 25R since our gate was on the south side of the terminal. We set up Runway 24L in the FMS but briefed both runways. I put the SMO 160 degree radial in the fix page since the departure references that radial for both runways. We were assigned [Runway] 25R when we called for taxi clearance. During the taxi; we selected the new runway and checked our performance numbers and flap setting. We also re-briefed the departure procedure noting that we were to fly runway heading (or 250) (I am filling out this entire report from memory) followed by a left turn to 235 crossing the SMO 160 (again this is from memory). We were given line up and wait followed by the clearance 'fly heading 250; cleared for takeoff' which we did. The Controller switched us to Departure followed by normal turns to the south and east around Long Beach. I think that it would drastically reduce pilot errors if a runway assignment was provided with the PDC rather when the airplane is beginning to taxi. This frequently requires a change to the briefed taxi route; SID; performance; taxi time (reference single engine taxi versus two engine taxi; engine out procedure; etc.) The result is that many changes have to be made to the FMS; performance; flap setting and briefings while taxiing. This is an invitation to a runway incursion or non-compliance with a SID. Additionally; SIDs and STARs are becoming increasingly complex. The constant 'fly the SID clearance except...' such as they do in SLC is very detrimental to safety. Additionally; it becomes very cumbersome to make change to the FMS to change a speed but not an altitude or vice-versa. We recently received a multi-page memo regarding ATC nomenclature on SIDs and STARs. It has become complex to the point that a pilot often needs to reference the memo in real time to be sure what the controller means. Alternatively; the controller can be questioned which I heard nearly every airplane do today while on the arrival to IAH. The procedures are asking for deviations or worse.

We check in at XA:X5 for an all-night flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. After arriving in ZZZ1 exhausted from working all night the crew has to sit 3 hours at a hub where it would be easy to crew the next flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 with a fresh crew that has slept. Instead a crew that has been up all night has to board and work a 2 hour flight.

1319,1319,1319,1319,2811,We pushed off the gate and started the engines. I noticed that the right pack light was on. We completed the QRH checklist. The pack light did not go out so we returned to the gate. A flight attendant called the cockpit to report that she heard a series of 4 beeps or alarms; possibly coming from the floor beneath the aft galley floor; as we taxied into the gate. Maintenance personnel reported that there were no vehicles in the vicinity of the gate as we taxied in and that there was nothing abnormal in the cargo compartment. No source of the sounds was found. Maintenance performed tests on the right pack and the engine at the gate. No problems were found. I got a new flight plan for FL240 as a precaution against a pack failure or loss of pressurization in flight.We experienced normal engine start; taxi; takeoff and climb. All systems were functioning normally so I chose to climb to FL280. Approximately 15 minutes after level off; Flight Attendant 1 called the cockpit to report that a flight attendant was feeling faint and was on oxygen. I told her to page for a physician and to call me back with an update. I checked the cabin altitude and the differential pressure. Both were normal; the cabin altitude was approximately 4;800 FT. I set the cruise altitude to FL240 and observed the cabin altitude decreasing. I requested a descent to FL240. A few minutes later; Flight Attendant 1 called back and that a passenger had become ill. Before completing her report on the ill passenger; she stated that another flight attendant was talking incoherently. I asked her if she had found a physician. I asked her to get me the passenger's seat number and to give an update on their condition. Flight Attendant 1 did not reply to my question about a physician and hung up; apparently to attend to the other flight attendant.The First Officer and I began to prepare to divert. I observed the cabin altitude decreasing and the differential pressure increasing. I then attempted to contact Dispatch via the radio to coordinate a diversion. I was unable to contact Dispatch. I informed ATC that we were going to divert. Flight Attendant 1 called again to report that another passenger was feeling faint with tingling in her fingers. She also reported that all of the oxygen bottles were being used and they needed to have the passenger oxygen system deployed. At this point; Flight Attendant 1 sounded hurried and alarmed so I deployed the masks. Deploying the oxygen masks would ensure that everyone had oxygen and that the flight attendants could then use the walk around bottles; if needed. We declared an emergency with ATC. We asked for further descent and a clearance to our divert airport. I made a PA informing the passengers that we were going to divert and would be landing in approximately 10 minutes. First Officer and I discussed donning our oxygen masks. We were descending thru approximately FL150 and the cabin altitude was approximately 2;000 FT and decreasing normally. There were no fumes or odors. There was no sign of smoke. The flight attendants did not report any fumes; odors or signs of smoke. I told First Officer that I felt fine and asked him how he felt. He replied that he was fine. Due to the fact that we were already in descent and would be below 10;000 FT very quickly; I felt that there would be no benefit to our use of the oxygen masks. Further; we had both been through military high altitude chamber training and are familiar with the effects of high altitude. We were not experiencing any symptoms and the cabin altitude was normal. I did not believe that there was an issue with the air quality in the cockpit or the cabin. From the information I was given by the flight attendants; the symptoms were limited to a couple of passengers and 2 flight attendants. Although unusual; I felt that the problems were caused by cabin altitude and not cabin air quality. We landed without incident and taxied to the gate. Paramedics met the aircraft. Ientered the cabin to assess the situation and coordinate with the paramedics. All passengers and flight attendants were alert and appeared normal. The paramedics entered the aircraft to assess the passengers' condition. The paramedics did not treat anyone. After approximately 10 minutes; the passengers deplaned. All passengers and crew appeared normal and walked off the aircraft under their own power. Several passengers complimented the flight attendants on their performance. Four passengers and one flight attendant went to the hospital. I was told that the passengers and the flight attendant were asthmatic. Two passengers returned and went on the flight to ORD. Only a few passengers reported symptoms. A non-revenue air carrier pilot reported that he had no symptoms although he was sitting behind an ill passenger. I have been informed that someone may think that I should have performed a Smoke; Fire or Fumes; Smoke or Fumes Removal; or other checklist during this event. I am submitting this report in response to a possible violation of procedure. There was no report of smoke; or fumes in the cabin. No odors were reported. The First Officer and I did not detect smoke; fumes or odors. The First Officer and I had discussed the fact that we had both been through military high altitude chamber training. I also discussed a loss of pressurization event I had in while flying an F-4. I am very familiar with the symptoms of hypoxia. The fact that only a few of the passengers were affected led me to conclude that whatever caused the symptoms was not airborne but was related to the cabin altitude and the overall health of those individual passengers and flight attendants. I am told that each affected passenger or crewmember is asthmatic. I also felt is was possible that the flight attendants and some passengers had not eaten that morning due to the early departure and that may have contributed to their symptoms. Deploying the passenger masks appeared to be the best solution to the problem. A rapid or emergency descent would not alleviate the symptoms as quickly as deploying the oxygen masks and were already at a relatively low cabin altitude. Completing the smoke removal or other checklist would have delayed the landing. My intent was to land as soon as possible and get medical attention for the ill passengers and crew. Having no known cause for the problem; I felt that was the best course of action.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1320,1320,1320,1320,1472,I emailed the Vice President of Safety and Security inquiring about our FAA Approved De-icing/Anti-Icing Procedure. At the time I was going through ground school and while reviewing such procedure in class; I found a conceptual conflict with previous training received about the same subject. I received a [reply] dismissing my Safety Concern. The letter explained two reasons for dismissal: First; current procedure is in compliance with FARs. And secondly; current procedure is in compliance with any FAA recommendations. I have to say I was disappointed with the response because I never said the current de-icing/anti-icing procedure wasn't FAA/FARs compliant. Otherwise; I would have contacted my Chief Pilot. Also I never said the current de-icing procedure was going against any FAA recommendations even if still in compliance and legal. The response was missing the point completely. Constructivism wasn't there either since there wasn't an explanation of why a change for the better was being ignored other than because 'we are in compliance already'.The change I proposed not only would increase Safety (Number One Company Value); but it would do it at no cost for the company. Here we start the procedure on the left wing going counter clockwise. [I believe that] they should start at the left wing but going clockwise. Difference; the importance of giving Hold Over Time (HOT) priority to the aircraft's tail. The tail should be granted maximum priority since two of the primary flight controls are on it and because testing at NASA Lewis found that the sharper edges of the horizontal stabilizer collects more ice than the rounded edges of the wings (transitioning to takeoff roll situation). Since by definition: 'Hold Over Time (HOT) starts when the final application of fluid commences and expires when the fluid loses its effectiveness;' it should be clear that the maximum protection for the tail (time wise) would be provided by the second method. Spraying the tail last (while other surfaces HOT is already counting) considering the time it takes to anti-ice an MD80 size aircraft; and considering HOT under several conditions may be only a few minutes; it will provide an extra assurance that tail HOT is being maximized. That was the philosophy and reasons why we were trained that way. This company doesn't share the same reasoning and I; at this point; am not sure why. Unless I'm wrong; we have a chance to make something good a little better a no cost.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1321,1321,1321,1321,298,There are currently no NOTAMs published for N40.Upon landing I see that the runway is not plowed full width; and there are large snow piles on either side of the runway that could result in an impact with low wing aircraft. The taxi way snow piles are high enough that low wing aircraft will strike their wing on them.Also the AWOS-3 has been INOP for at least a year and I've never seen a NOTAM.Someone could easily strike a wing or flap on the snow piles during takeoff or landing and end up in an accident. The problem is caused by the airport management's ongoing failure to publish NOTAMs. N40 has forty (40) separate owners. which may lead to a 'if everyone is in charge; no one is in charge' situation.

1324,1324,1324,1324,5112,This was a fatigue call issue due to an impossible reschedule.  Original trip was two legs with 7 hours of duty.  Reschedule was four legs with 14 hours of duty ending late at night.  Then I was told to call when I get to destination to start exactly 8 hours of rest to one leg early followed by 10 hours of rest in the middle of the day and then one leg in the evening!   If this sounds too incredible to believe I assure you its true.  After the second leg; I called scheduling and told them this pairing was likely to induce fatigue and I didn't see any way my body could handle it.  I was trying to give them advance notice so they could make other plans.  They said to call from destination.  I called and said I was very fatigued.  They offered 9 hours of rest (which would still be reduced) and I said no; I need normal (10 hours) rest to safely operate in the morning.  I understand the pairing was legal; but the idea that a person can work a 14+ hour day and then sleep a minimal 6 or so hours before returning to work is beyond my comprehension.Many Many things could and should be change.  This pairing reschedule delves into the heart of the reasons this industry needs comprehensive restructure of pilot duty/rest rules.  It shows that the idea of 'rest before you fly' doesn't always work well.  If your morning schedule is short enough; you can legally be put on absolute minimum rest after an absolute maximum duty day.  Even if the morning is just one flight; the reduction of safety for that one flight exists.  Also; this pairing has a rest period during the middle of day in a trip where every other day has flying in the middle of the day and rest at night.

1329,1329,1329,1329,9461,While flying at night on February 2015 to CLT; the CLT Approach Controller advised us that the CLT Runway 5 Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights were inoperative.  The Approach Controller also advised us that there were some red lights on the ground to the left of Runway 5; past Taxiway Foxtrot; that had the appearance of PAPI lights.  He advised us to ignore these lights.  We were glad that the Controller briefed us in advance of this issue.  As we flew our visual approach; backed up by the Runway 5 ILS; we noticed four distinct red lights situated in a horizontal line to the left of the touchdown zone.  The lights appeared to be PAPI lights (from left to right) in the red; red; red; red configuration ('RED on WHITE you're all right; RED on RED Pilot is dead.').  We confirmed that we were on the glidepath all the way to touchdown using the ILS.  However; the optical illusion of the four red lights (looked exactly like four red PAPI lights) caught our attention as we flew the approach.

However; doing so was like someone saying; 'Trust me; ignore the red traffic lights ahead; proceed through the intersection without regard for those red traffic lights.'  Flying an approach at night with what appears to be four red PAPI lights goes against everything a Pilot is trained 'not to do.'  After landing; we began our taxi to the gate and noticed a grouping of what appeared to be many temporary red lights in a construction zone in an area between Runway 5; Taxiway Foxtrot; Taxiway Mike; and Taxiway Mike 2.  On the ground the red lights took on a whole different appearance.  They did not look at all like PAPI lights; just a random grouping of red lights.  Somehow; when viewing the lights during an approach to Runway 5; these lights look exactly like four red PAPI lights.  I recommend that these lights be shielded or blocked in some way so that Pilots making the approach to CLT Runway 5 do not mistake the red construction lights for PAPI lights.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1332,1332,1332,1332,8696,Ground issued a taxi clearance to taxi to Runway 10; via Runway 16 and Alpha.  We were parked at the main terminal ramp.  Trying to figure out where to exit the ramp; we stopped at the hold short line; of what turned out to be Runway 16/34.  Runway 4/22 is depicted on the airport Diagram as a closed runway; and does not have the runway numbers depicted.  We realized this; and before we could ask to use 16/34 to taxi to (closed) Runway 4; ATC told us to utilize Runway 16 to Runway 4 to Alpha to hold short Runway 10.  Based upon various parking conditions and congestion; it would be very easy to depart the ramp area; and mistake Runway 16/34 as a parallel taxiway due to its close relative position to the ramp area; and narrow width.  The lack of a Runway 4/22 on the Airport Diagram; congested; small ramp; added to the confusion and increase workload.  Additionally; this airport does not utilize the enhanced runway hold short markings; and the hold short markings at Taxiway A and Runway 10 are a bit faded.

This isn't listed as a NOTAM; or on the Jeppesen chart. Please update Company Ops Notes to include these items.  Please recommend that ATC be cognizant of these issues when issuing taxi clearance to our aircraft; and provide an initial progressive taxi; whether requested or not; to ensure that the aircraft make the proper exit at the North end of the terminal ramp to avoid a potential for runway incursion by entering Runway 16/34 unintentionally.

I informed the controller about this fact and that I had missed the exit.  She answered that that I had not and was right by where I was.  I could see the Echo sign; but not the actual taxi way. I therefore turned the aircraft 90 degrees to shine my landing light onto the side of the runway.  The controller thought that I was turning the aircraft 180 which I was not.At the end I was not able to see exit Echo and followed the controller's instructions down to Delta that I found easily due to the green lights marking the exit. This was a very frustrating experience since I had reviewed the ground chart and knew where I was going.

1335,1335,1335,1335,9953,I was assigned a 4 day trip from the crew desk. I was only good for 2 days but was given this trip which overlapped and made me illegal for my [following] trip I had bid for. The check in was XA:01; a deadhead segment on an oversold aircraft. Upon arriving to ZZZ at XG:10 I had to sit 2:50 min before beginning. I was exhausted by the time I was to begin my first ZZZZ leg as I had now been up since XD:00 on the day prior to begin my reserve day. I told my flying partners I had been giving this ID and was feeling tired. I noticed it took me longer to complete my safety checks and I was losing focus during my silent review of my evacuation responsibilities. I completed the first leg and arrived in ZZZZ. I had a 52 minute layover before returning to ZZZ. There was a flight attendant crew change but I was scheduled to stay onboard and work the ZZZZ- ZZZ segment back. The new crew came onboard. 2 working flight attendants and 1 deadheading flight attendant as she was a Spanish speaker and I too had been scheduled to be a Spanish speaker. During this flight I began to lose focus and task management skills were dwindling. My mental awareness; cabin awareness was less and less focused. I began pouring hot drinks in the wrong cups and cold drinks in the hot cups. I found myself feeling so exhausted I didn't feel very stable on my feet. At this point I was concerned with my responsibilities of arming; disarming my door let alone my ability to respond to a medical or aircraft emergency. I was finding it more and more difficult to make Spanish language announcements as there is no written booklet and translations are done simultaneously and from memory. I was serving my passengers slower and missed 2 rows all together. Upon landing; I was able to disarm my door and perform an all call. As I walked off the plane I couldn't remember if I had disarmed my door and my flying partner verified once again that I had but I clearly couldn't remember and wasn't for sure unless my flying partner confirmed this. I landed at XO:00 which was approximately a 12:30 duty day. I now had to wait for a hotel van to pick me up. I waited 28 minutes before calling the hotel and a taxi was sent to pick me up as I told the lady I couldn't wait as I could barely stay standing at this point. I finally was in my hotel room at XP:15; 13 hours and 15 min late which basically meant I had been up for approximately 36 hours. I had an 18:40 min layover before I had to begin an 11:20 hr duty day which was a ZZZZ1 turn 8:15 min flight time with an hour layover in between. I was very slow moving and found that I couldn't remember customers drink requests; meal requests and once again had to out loud announce to myself I was arming the door as I was trying to do something to remind myself that I had armed and disarmed my door. I felt very exhausted and was concern that I may fall asleep on the jumpseat. I had a 25:13 mi. Layover after this day and I slept approximately 12 1/2 hours. I had a very short day the next day a 2 hour flight to ZZZZ with a 11:50 min layover. I felt more rested but still tired. My last leg consisted of a nonstop approximately 4:00 flight from ZZZZ to ZZZ1 with a deadhead segment to my base to finish out this ID. When I checked my schedule; Mr X from scheduling had assigned me a ZZZ2 turn on [the following day] almost 17 hours later. Flight time is 10:21 min and duty time would've been 13:36. The ZZZ2 turn was assigned to me to fulfill a guarantee to my line as scheduling took away my [original trip] I had bid for and scheduled me [a new trip] on my last two days of my reserve month. I had to decline this trip as I was not concerned I would not be able to safely fly and fulfill my duties on another long one day international turn trip. A pairing like this that has a check in after midnight with a sit before tagging on segments in the early morning is dangerous and unhealthy for workers. I felt fatigued; tired my task management skills were below average;my awareness for medical emergencies and or cabin awareness was lacking and not as acute as needed. My energy was [gone] such that I could not write this report until a few days later. I experienced twitching under my eyes and my urine displayed a golden rod color which is evidence of dehydration. I scraped my knee on the jumpseat as I ran [in] to it. This type of pairing will eventually result in an accident of some sort. Scheduling isn't aware of the personal experience of these flights they schedule. They look at the time on paper without any awareness of what it is like to complete a flight on limited sleep. When one is on reserve starting at XF:00 am they remain available for a 24 hour period so if one gets a phone call and XW:00 to report at XA:00 then be expected to work this is a potentially dangerous situation. If all nighter flights that include an additional segment are to be scheduled a legal layover should follow the all night segment.

1336,1336,1336,1336,8801,On the ENDEE Arrival into MDW we were cleared to descend via. There is a crossing restriction to cross NOGEE at or below FL180. On the descent we were on the snowflake and complied and were below FL180 per the profile at NOGEE. However; the altimeter setting was approximately 30.50 so once crossing NOGEE; we set in the altimeter setting and the altimeter spun above 18;000 FT briefly. We continued the arrival as instructed.I do not believe we erred here. The instruction was to cross at or below FL180. Flight levels are predicated on a standard ALT setting of 29.92; so you are expected (based on my view) to cross that fix at or below 18;000 with a 29.92 setting. That is exactly what we did; we crossed [at or] below FL180. In my opinion; however; this is a problematic OPD and I see it creating problems. Having a crossing restriction at the transition altitude is a threat (again; in my opinion) and creates a potential for deviations. If the altimeter is set; for example; too early while conducting the checklist and the local ALT is low (i.e. 29.60 for example) then the crew could potentially cross high when they believe they are on profile. In our case; when you wait to set it until after crossing the fix and going below FL180; if you wait too late; you will set yourself up for failure on the next fix which is to cross KOOKS at or below 16;000 (which must be done with a local setting; so if the ALT is very high and you delay in setting the ALT; you have a lot of ALT to make up in a short period of time). It may be prudent to consider revising the crossing restrictions on this OPD to mitigate issues.

1338,1338,1338,1338,10102,This report was composed by an Instructor at FBO (at ZZZ). I am not the Students primary Instructor. A Student had to initiate a go-around after getting close to 'traffic to follow' while on short final to Runway XX. The private pilot Student completed FAR 91.103 requirements before proceeding with his local pattern flight. Weather was not a factor during today's mishap. ATIS information (XA56Z) reported winds calm; 10 miles visibility; sky condition clear; temperature 29; dew point 2 degrees Celsius; altimeter 29.97; visual approach to Runway XX. Fuel onboard was 20 gallons. Student was also familiar with Runway lengths as well as takeoff and landing distances. Student had on his person government issued photo ID; medical; proper logbook endorsements; and Student pilot certificate. Onboard aircraft (required documentation complied with).Student's last flight was 9 days ago. An aircraft had dropped FOD on the active XX Runway while the Student was on a solo flight in the pattern. Runway XX was closed temporarily while airport vehicles were dispatched to find the FOD. Meanwhile the Student was told to hold South of Runway XX. After the Student asked for clarification the controller told him to make 360s south of the airport. Student made 3 360s south of the Runway; meanwhile the FOD was found and Runway XX operations were resumed. Student then re-established himself on the left downwind for XX when he was then told to extend his downwind. Student was told number 3 to land Runway XX. Student waited till number 2 traffic was 45 degrees off his left shoulder before turning base. Student quickly overtook traffic on final and initiated a go-around while the traffic to follow was still on short final. Prior to this go-around Student had been told to initiate a go-around by Tower. A compilation of unfamiliar radio calls in the traffic pattern; 360s; downwind extension; a temporary runway closure; and two go-arounds narrowed the margin of safety and nearly exceeded the Student pilot's piloting capabilities; leading to a close spacing on final which lead to a go-around. The Student pilot feels remorse for what happened and the event has been debriefed in detail. The Student pilot has learned from his mistakes. The primary cause was pilot error; a high workload led to decreased situational awareness in the pattern.,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1339,1339,1339,1339,9004,Two F16's doing a practice ILS to Runway 2L at FAI; were issued relatively standard climb outs of heading 032 and maintain 5;000 FT. A MLG (Medium-Large Transport) was inbound to hold over the Chena NDB (CUN) at 4;000 FT. Preceding departure off Runway 2L was a PA31; climbing on initial departure heading of 032; issued direct Bettles (BTT) leaving 3;400 FT. Basically; I got boxed into a situation and the choice I made to attempt to remedy the situation was not good enough. The PA31 was still climbing out on the 032 heading when the F16's reported their missed approach on my frequency. At that time the MLG was still SE of CUN and level at 4;000 FT. I was relatively certain I would lose separation with the PA31 had I left the F16's climbing out on the 032 heading; so I chose to anticipate that the climb rate of the F16s would be good enough to top the MLG if I turned them out of 3;400 FT. When I observed their climb rate it was not as anticipated and it was too late to make another choice; so I attempted to establish visual separation and called traffic to the MLG; reference F16 flight. He acknowledged my transmission but did not report the traffic in sight. I immediately issued traffic to the F16's reference the MLG and asked him to report the traffic in sight; thinking often military aircraft are better at visually acquiring other aircraft. The F16's responded that flight visibility was less than a mile at his location. By now the F16's were 3-4 NM from the MLG and climbing through 4;000 FT; so I immediately told the F16's no delay climbing to 5;000 FT. The F16's acknowledged the instruction; but did not report level at 5;000 FT until after there was no longer 3 NM of lateral separation. It is important to understand that our IFR departures off Runway 2L are initially assigned a heading of 032 degrees and we are unable to turn those aircraft until they are at or above the MVA. While the MVA initially off the runway end is 2;200 FT; it increases to 3;400 FT within 4NM. With departing MLGs; C208s; and PA31s this means that we usually cannot turn the aircraft until they are above 3;400 FT. I am not privy to what; if any; discussion occurred in the Tower Cab with regard to Local Control's responsibility to provide initial IFR separation between successive departures. I clearly understand that it is the responsibility of the RADAR Controller to protect the departure corridor as well as any required separation once control instructions off the initial departure instructions are issued. With that in mind; had I been working Local Control in this situation; I would not have allowed PA31 to depart in front of F16's on the approach given the weather conditions and the performance characteristics of the F-16s after completing their option. This is particularly true given the limitations on the RADAR Controller with regard to turning aircraft off the initial departure heading due to the MVAs with a lack of diverse vectoring area or any other approved initial headings for IFR departures. Recommendation; I could have attempted to attain diverging courses by putting the PA31 on a vector away from the departure corridor and left the F16's on the initial departure heading; although I believe the speed differential might still have closed the gap before the PA31 reached 3;400 FT for the turn. On initial contact I could have instructed the F16's to climb without delay and that might have attained the desired climb rate and subsequently the required vertical separation. I could have descended the MLG in an attempt to increase the vertical separation sooner. I could have vectored the MLG in an attempt to archive diverging courses between the MLG and the F16's on a vector. Had Local Control not launched the PA31 in front of F16's on approach; the situation would not have existed and F16's would have climbed out on the 032 heading until above the MLG. I believe the most important recommendation would be to either restore a diverse vectoring area toFAI; or at least provide more than one heading for IFR departures to fly initially on departure. This would provide both the Tower and RADAR Controllers more options to safely and efficiently move the traffic. In this case; had I been able to assign the F16's a different climb-out then I believe I could have prevented the incident completely.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1340,1340,1340,1340,9102,ENN is located about 35 nm south of FAI. FAI is a large hub main international airport. ENN is the only logical alternate airport for General Aviation at FAI. ENN is a City owned airport which receives FAA funds to operate publicly periodically. ENN Ground Maintenance is almost non existent. Sometimes the snow plowing is left not properly plowed for weeks. Their ability to turn out timely properly created NOTAMs is almost non existent. The airport beacon is functional. None of the runway lights function. The runway end identifier lights somewhat work. The PAPIs do not work. Been over a year since the lights worked period. When and if they snowplow it's a small path a pick-up truck would use; a recipe/trap for a catastrophe.

1342,1342,1342,1342,1840,I was planning a visual approach to the runway to descend to pattern altitude. I circled at an area 10 miles northwest of the field and then commenced a 10 mile 45 degree approach to left downwind of the runway. I noticed at the time that after descending to pattern altitude; the hills northwest of the field blocked my line of sight to the area corresponding to left crosswind and the first half of the downwind leg for the pattern of the runway. I announced my intentions on the CTAF at 10; 5; and 3 miles from the field. I heard radio transmissions from an aircraft approximately 5 miles behind me also approaching the field; but was unsure as to whether there were any other aircraft in the pattern at the time. As it turned out; there was another aircraft in the pattern that had just turned from crosswind to downwind at the time I entered the pattern. I had not heard or seen the aircraft already in the pattern; and transmissions from this aircraft suggested that the pilot had not heard any of my transmissions and was not aware of my presence until I joined the pattern. There was no risk of collision in this particular incident. I believe that the pilot already in the pattern slowed his aircraft and then extended his downwind to ensure separation was maintained. The hills to the northwest of the airport appear to interfere with the ability of aircraft on a 45 degree approach to left downwind for the runway and aircraft on left crosswind for the runway to see each other and hear each others' radio transmissions. I think that it would be much better for safety if this runway had a right-hand pattern to avoid interference to vision and radio propagation from the hills to the northwest of the airport.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

He also stated that he learned that there was a Management decision in order to save money; not to have spare engines. I do not know if this is true. We as pilots have been screaming that Maintenance is broken and must be fixed. It falls on deaf ears when we say it; but where is the FAA in this. The history of this aircraft is not a secret.

It couldn't take that much paint to paint the runway number in a place that could be seen by the pilots when in position for takeoff. We also often takeoff on parallel runways so a runway number would be final confirmation that we are on the proper runway. Day VFR may not pose too much of a problem; but night IFR with drizzling rain at an unfamiliar airport could. In ATL we often use Runway 9L M2 for takeoff.

1353,1353,1353,1353,7356,ADSB/GPS Outage in the Denver Metro area. At around XA:00Z D01 notified ZZZ1 that there are GPS (to include ADSB) anomalies within 50 miles of Denver. We immediately started broadcasting this on the ATIS. As traffic has picked up today (still relatively slow for ZZZ1); we've had numerous reports of aircraft losing ADSB; and numerous reports of aircraft losing GPS. We also lost all ADSB on our side for approximately an hour. This is problematic for our operation. Since the implementation of ADSB; we have had many controllers train and certify using this feature. I am currently the only controller on shift that certified prior to ADSB. If our traffic was moderate it would be a safety concern; especially during a VFR pop up arrival rush. As for the GPS outages; most of the aircraft reported losing their GPS on finals from as far out as 15 miles to within 1 mile final. Luckily today is VFR. However; this time of year through April are our heaviest precipitation months.  Often strong frontal patterns move in quickly; with last minute changes in forecast. We provide service for pilots with little experience; and though today is VFR; many general aviation aircraft have returned to base due to GPS outages. We have logged aircraft reporting issues in our facility log. We currently have 11 reports. There are many that have inquired about outages; but did not report an outage themselves. We are not seeing all aircraft ADSB on our side. When we lose their ADSB in the pattern; we are full stopping them to keep the operation safe. We also have the concern for the aircraft that are losing their ADSB while flying under the Bravo airspace. I am simply passing along safety information. I have heard of a 'solar storm' and I am aware of the 5G implementation. I will not speculate on the cause of the outages today.

1355,1355,1355,1355,8354,There were low ceilings and visibility in two major airports.  Airport 1 was down to 1/4 mile and needed to be monitored constantly for legality.  There was a multitude of issues that created task saturation and safety issues starting with the ongoing computer issues with dispatch monitor giving incorrect and unsafe altitudes for route of flight.  It takes up to eleven attempts and playing around with numbers to come up with a safe altitude taking up valuable time.  Issues with the flight planning computer crashing and problems with releases not showing up at the gate.  In the morning there are two Dispatchers working six desks so there is little back up in case conditions get bad; also the last Dispatcher of the morning not coming in at XA:45 local means spread out flights for everyone until that time.  Airport 1 went into flow in mid morning and that means the extra burden of sending ACARS to the crews.  A deluge of calls from flight crews about their new departure times and having to deal with the delay program and monitoring taxi times.  It's impossible to do all of this and properly flight follow.  Another problem we have is broken aircraft causing multiple swaps and having to redo flight releases.  Two Dispatchers this week have sent e-mails to computer support about altitudes and program functionality and were told nothing they can do for either and even asked the Dispatcher to contact flight planning program support.  I didn't know technical support was part of our job!We need our computers and programs to work properly and better support when we have computer issues.  We need every desk to be a full time desk with an earlier start time and thus the need for more Dispatchers.  We need more timely repair of our aircraft and nav loads done on time so we don't have to spend the time building non-rnav routes when this could be avoided.

The three new flight attendants were incredibly personable and did their best to operate the trip as they were trained; but as all of us can attest when we are new to a position; there is a big difference between learning something in training and putting it to practice in the real world. I do not know what the training footprint or scheduling rules are for FAs; but I was incredibly surprised to learn this was even legal. Yes; the FAs are trained for safety events; but would three brand new FAs be able to manage the cabin well? I would greatly appreciate more insight into the FA training footprint; what their level of OE is before being signed off; and would love to see a no all-low-time crew restriction. Even having just one experienced flight attendant; even one with just 100 hours or so; would have been extremely helpful for providing much better service and ensuring the highest level of safety.

If we tell ATC that we cannot meet the restriction; should they not note it to the other controller's along the route?  We find that they want us to inform the next controller.  Pilots are taught once we notify a controller that is all that is required. 2) Note all speed restrictions and altitudes in Bold Black Letters [and] not hide them on second pages in notes due to the excessive ATC points on the plates in a small area on both arrivals and departures. 3) On the arrival into MEM when the arrival is loaded; which we were cleared for in our flight plan we received at OSH. The flight plan read OSH-DLL-PLL-DYR-WLDER7.MEM. We entered the flight plan in our Garmin 530W avionics and it needed to know the landing runway in order to proceed with the flight plan entry but with variable winds we just selected Runway 18 and it entered the arrival however we noticed that not all of the points were listed on the arrival and only after we changed the runway to Runway 36 did we see all of the points on the arrival and altitudes. The name of the game is confusion in the cockpit and now also with altitudes that can be chosen up to the pilots between the minimum and maximum at different points.

1374,1374,1374,1374,6739,Pairing was scheduled with a red eye on the first leg with a scheduled arrival time of [Day 0] XA:10 local to rest in a hotel room for the day and to report back to the airport the same day [Day 0] at XP:40. The van ride to the hotel was approximately 30 minutes each way which significantly decreased the amount of time available for meaningful rest. Once I was able to go to bed; I was only able to sleep for 4 hours due to normal daytime activity noise in the hotel and its location; nestled between 3 major highways with extremely loud traffic noise.The original pairing would have us depart at [Day 0] XP:40 to fly to [our first destination] and arrive in [second stop] at [Day 1] XU:13.  However; a severe maintenance delay when our inbound aircraft reached the gate caused everything to be pushed back by almost 5 hours. Instead of notifying the crew of the delay in a timely manner and sending us all back to the hotel to rest and prepare ourselves to fly  another red eye (now our 2nd in a row; unscheduled); the Company chose to have us remain in the airport for the entire 4.5 hour duration with nowhere to rest until our flight was to depart after midnight; causing the crew to fly in to the early morning hours of the day; arriving after  [Day 1] XA:00 in [final destination].  This pushed Flight Duty Period (FDP) limits to within 30 minutes of what was legal and did not provide the crew with any preparation time to be truly fit for duty to fly two red eyes back to back.  With this long sit in the airport with nowhere to rest; I felt fatigued during the flight to [first stop] and even more so on the leg to [final destination]. Delaying a flight for almost 5 hours that late at night was a poor decision on behalf of the Company.  It did not allow the crew to have time to prepare to fly this type of schedule. With all of the emphasis on crew rest; fatigue and safety; this type of oversight should not be happening. The Company handled this situation extremely poorly and is a clear indicator of their blatant disregard for safe crew operations and lack of big picture thinking when it comes to scheduling and pilot rest and is reckless. While the Company adheres to the technical legality of FAR 117  FDP rules; as evidence shows; legal does not necessarily mean safe.  Additionally and of note: It is common knowledge that pilots are occasionally being lectured on professionalism as a result of their fatigue call.  Pilots who call in fatigued at [my company] are sometimes met with intimidating and demeaning encounters with the Chief Pilot once they arrive at their gate (if they've notified the Company of the fatigue enroute).  This naturally dissuades pilots from calling in fatigued when they are in fact fatigued and causes pilots to accept flight assignments that they may not be as fit for as they should be.  This seems to be especially true for probationary pilots. The Company can make better choices when it comes to crew scheduling and consider a broader picture when making operational decisions.  Organize pairings with red eyes that allow for more realistic and meaningful rest before the next scheduled duty assignment.  After a red eye; do not schedule more flying on the same day with required rest to be accomplished in a hotel during the day and most certainly not 2 red eyes back to back. The company must make a broader; more educated decision when it comes to flight crews and what kind of schedules they are able to reasonably and safely fly. While these pairings look efficient on paper and are technically legal; these schedules are running crews into the ground and are conducive to an unsafe flight environment with other potential breakdowns in safety.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

1377,1377,1377,1377,2345,Our autobrake policy is unsafe when combined with the calculated landing data; which is empirically inaccurate to a significant degree.  When landing a fully-loaded B737-800 on this short runway; the output was bracketed '-180' for the stopping margin on autobrakes 3.  Because our autobrake policy is; in my opinion; exceptionally unsafe; I was not allowed to select 3; and was required to either pull the switch out over the guard and use Max which would make a violent stop on the dry runway; or set 0. I felt forced to use 0; since the last time this happened (and I reported it) I used MAX and the airplane stopped so quickly I used less than 1/2 of the runway. Choosing zero was not the safest choice.  Pilots every day are forced to choose between either 'far too much braking' at max; or 'zero braking' at zero because of our poor autobrake policy.  Perhaps 1 out of 3 landings on short runways force the Pilots to sigh and turn the switch off. In this case; the landing output showed me going off the end of the runway by 200 FT with autobrakes 3 and having only a 1;300 foot margin at autobrakes max.  As always; I normally; manually braked the airplane using a medium effort and easily slowed to 60 KTS well before the end.  The calculated number is incorrect.  It is wrong.  It is not accurate.  The procedure that requires us to use inaccurate data to turn off autobrakes when we are at the heaviest allowing autobrakes to add the greatest margin of safety is; in itself; unsafe.  Why does it make sense to anyone to have Crew after Crew sigh; reach up and turn off the autobrakes when we are close to our max landing weight?  If the calculation provided even close to accurate landing data; then the policy to not use bracketed autobrake selection would make some sense (but not really; I want the brakes on as soon as I touch down; like every other operator allows).  But the calculation clearly does not come anywhere close to providing accurate data (I think it's off by between 35% to 45%).  Can we please address this?  I'm sending the actual data to you via email; but I do not want to ever land a fully-loaded -800 on a short runway with autobrakes off.  It isn't the safe answer.

1378,1378,1378,1378,6970,Flight number assignment at our Airline result in similar callsigns cause both an increase in pilot Controller communications in saturated ATC environments and resultantly increase the risk of inadvertent clearance and miss-communication which can lead to minor deviation or serious error. Although no error is being reported for this flight due to aggressive hear-back/readback awareness; this callsign situation needs to be addressed. On a particular day; three departures from the same airport in the late evening had similar callsigns: ABC X24; ABC Y24; and ABC Z22. On taxi out alone; I had to clarify with Ground Control that the clearance issued was for our flight (X24) and not Y24; in effect; doubling pilot-controller communications. We had to specify again while enroute that it was our flight to switch frequencies versus the misheard other. This experience is bad enough here in domestic operations; but is far worse in operation in the international theater where difficult accents (for both pilots and controllers) complicate the situation even more. I've flown into a European airport as X60 with Y60 on the same frequency; or from another European airport on X57; with Y57 trying to work the same ATC enroute and oceanic frequencies. This sometimes happens inadvertently when another airline has the same flight number; but is a terrible practice when the airline itself is setting up the chain of events that lead to communication errors. Although no errors occurred during this particular segment; the potential was great. As such; this is a communications safety issue that can and should be addressed promptly before a misheard clearance results in deviation or error.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

The controller was unaware of the object's presence. Upon further investigation; the controller informed me that it appeared to be a balloon with some sort of device tethered and freely swinging from the bottom of the balloon.This was consistent with my observation.

The VASI; which has been in place for around 60 years; enhances safety significantly by allowing pilots to be sure that they are safely above the hills near the runway under the final approaches in both directions. The VASI has been out of service for over 7 months. The FBO operator explained that the FAA instructed the city to remove it from service because terrain protruded too close to the VASI glide slope outside of 5 degrees laterally from centerline. The city installed baffling; to limit the viewing to 5 degrees either side of centerline; and various exchanges have gone back and forth between the city and the FAA since then. Apparently now they are awaiting the FAA test flight; but there is no schedule for that. The VASI has been in service for around 60 years; and there has never been a VASI-related accident at RBG.

1386,1386,1386,1386,7546,[I] reported early morning for the last day of 3-day trip.  Before my last leg home; I was pulled from my flight and told to call Scheduling.  Upon calling Scheduling to find out what was happening; I was informed that I had additional flying added to my day.  Initially; upon hearing that my release time was in the evening; I told Scheduling I couldn't work that late because I needed to get home and help care for my mom.  I was marked down as sick and called and left a message for Inflight Supervisor.  Today; when I was pre-writing another 'fatigue' report; I realized that the flying that was added to my day was illegal.  Three legs were added to my day; which would have resulted in a duty day of 15 hours and 27 minutes. I am forced to use sick days when I cannot or I'm unable to fly the legs Scheduling assigns to me.  When I use more than 12 sick days in a 12 month period; I can be put on disciplinary action and potentially loose my job. With Scheduling abusing the scheduling system; I have now used two sick days in two weeks.  At this rate; I will be out of a job in just a few months. This is wrong!The company is routinely scheduling flight attendants almost to their maximum with 12 and 12.5 hour duty days and 9-10 hour rests.  Flight attendants are calling in sick and Scheduling is frantically trying to fill the slots with the reserve flight attendants it has available; even if it means flying us beyond our physical well-being; as well as the safety of the passengers.  The FAA needs to change the regulations governing duty hours of flight attendants.  The company can use 'irregular operations' every day; any time of day.  Until the government changes the regulations; the company will continue to work us to the maximum; even if the maximum is not healthy or safe.  The union contract cannot negotiate for better work conditions when the government says 14 hour duty days are ok and 8-10 hour rests are ok.  Also; these short rests DO NOT take into consideration that our rest starts when we leave the aircraft and ends when we report back to the aircraft.  Rest should begin when we get to the hotel and when we leave the hotel.  With the current system; if you allow 20 minutes to hotel; 20 minutes in morning back to airport; as well as time for meals and showering (1.5 hours); there is not much time for sleep.....only 6-8 hours.
